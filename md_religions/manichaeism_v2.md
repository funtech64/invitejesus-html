text# Manichaeism
## Introduction
Manichaeism was a dualistic religion founded in the 3rd century CE by Mani in Persia, blending Zoroastrian, Christian, and Gnostic elements. It emphasized the cosmic struggle between light and darkness, spreading across the Roman Empire and Asia.
## View on God
Manichaeism was dualistic, worshiping a supreme God of Light (Father of Greatness) against a dark force (King of Darkness). Lesser divine beings aided the light; Mani was a prophet of the God of Light.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on liberating divine light through purity and asceticism. Moral codes emphasized vegetarianism, chastity, and charity for the Elect (priests). Taboos included harming light particles or indulging in materialism.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 14th century CE. Historically practiced by millions across Persia, Rome, and China. Modern revivals are negligible.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Manichaeism incorporated Christianity, viewing Jesus as a divine messenger of light, not the unique Son of God. Mani was seen as the final prophet, complementing Jesus. Manichaean theology influenced early Christian debates but was later deemed heretical.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved the soulâ€™s liberation to the Realm of Light, with the righteous joining the God of Light. The wicked faced temporary punishment in a dark realm. Rituals like fasting and prayers purified the soul for ascent.[^39][^40]
