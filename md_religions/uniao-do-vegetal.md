text# União do Vegetal
## Introduction
União do Vegetal (UDV) is a Brazilian syncretic religion founded in 1961 by José Gabriel da Costa. It combines Christianity, Spiritism, and indigenous Amazonian traditions, using ayahuasca (called "hoasca") as a sacrament for spiritual enlightenment and communion.
## View on God
UDV is monotheistic, worshiping the Christian God as the supreme creator, often called the Divine or Supreme Being. God is accessible through ayahuasca, which reveals divine truths. Spirits, including Christian and indigenous figures, serve as guides.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on peace, charity, and spiritual development, blending Christian and Spiritist principles. Moral codes promote love, honesty, and respect for nature, with ayahuasca rituals fostering ethical reflection. Taboos include misuse of the sacrament and harming others.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–30,000 adherents, primarily in Brazil (Amazonas, São Paulo), with communities in the US, Europe, and Australia. Growth is limited due to legal restrictions on ayahuasca and its structured organization.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
UDV is explicitly Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God and a central figure of salvation. Ayahuasca ceremonies include Christian prayers and hymns, with Jesus seen as a master teacher guiding spiritual growth. The religion integrates Spiritist and indigenous elements but remains rooted in Christian theology.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
UDV combines Christian and Spiritist afterlife beliefs, emphasizing reincarnation and spiritual evolution. After death, the soul undergoes judgment, with the righteous advancing to higher spiritual planes and the wicked facing purification through rebirth. No eternal hell exists; ayahuasca rituals prepare the soul for divine unity through cycles of learning.[^19][^20]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 43/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca). This completes the Syncretic & Ayahuasca category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Esoteric & Occult (6 religions: Hermeticism, Thelema, Chaos Magick, Satanism, Luciferianism, Gnosticism) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, I can start New Religious Movements (14 religions, which could be split into smaller batches) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 2 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., all 6 for Esoteric & Occult).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!Please continueThanks for the go-ahead! I'll proceed with the Esoteric & Occult category, covering 6 religions: Hermeticism, Thelema, Chaos Magick, Satanism, Luciferianism, and Gnosticism (modern revivals). Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., hermeticism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 49/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to New Religious Movements (14 religions, which I can split into two batches of ~7) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category (e.g., Umbrella-Claimant Cults). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
