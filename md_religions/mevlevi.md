text# Mevlevi
## Introduction
The Mevlevi Order, founded in the 13th century by followers of Rumi in Turkey, is a Sufi order emphasizing spiritual love and whirling dance within Sunni Islam.
## View on God
Mevlevi is monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the sole God. Divine love is central to mysticism.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and spiritual unity. Moral codes include dhikr, poetry, and dance. Taboos involve pride.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million followers, primarily in Turkey and Central Asia. Growth is modest.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a prophet, not divine, per Islamic belief. Christianity is respected.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic beliefs: paradise or hell. Whirling dance prepares the soul.[^20]
