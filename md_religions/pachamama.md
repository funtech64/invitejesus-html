text# Pachamama
## Introduction
Pachamama devotion, practiced by Andean peoples in Peru and Bolivia, is a traditional faith worshiping Pachamama (earth mother) for fertility and harmony.
## View on God
Pachamama devotion is polytheistic, venerating Pachamama alongside deities like Inti and Viracocha.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on reciprocity and environmental care. Moral codes include offerings and respect. Taboos involve harming the earth.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 2‚Äì3 million followers, primarily in Peru and Bolivia. Growth is tied to Andean communities.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized with Inti or Viracocha. Christianity is widely integrated.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms. No heaven/hell; offerings ensure harmony.[^30]
