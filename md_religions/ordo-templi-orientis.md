text# Ordo Templi Orientis
## Introduction
Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), founded in 1895 in Germany, is an esoteric movement emphasizing ritual magic and spiritual liberation, later led by Aleister Crowley.
## View on God
OTO is pantheistic, viewing divinity as universal energy. No personal deity; spiritual forces guide rituals.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal freedom and enlightenment. Moral codes include self-discovery and ritual discipline. Taboos involve coercion.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 3,000â€“10,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a symbolic figure, not divine. Christianity is often rejected for dogmatism.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^10]
