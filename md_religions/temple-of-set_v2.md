text# Temple of Set
## Introduction
The Temple of Set, founded in 1975 by Michael Aquino in the US, is a new religious movement emphasizing self-deification and Setian philosophy.
## View on God
The Temple is henotheistic, worshiping Set as consciousness. Other deities are symbolic.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-realization (Xeper). Moral codes include knowledge and responsibility. Taboos involve stagnation.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000â€“5,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is rejected.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual immortality. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
