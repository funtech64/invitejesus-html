text# Humanism
## Introduction
Humanism, rooted in Renaissance philosophy, is a secular worldview emphasizing human potential, reason, and ethics without reliance on religion.
## View on God
Humanism is non-theistic, rejecting gods or leaving the question open, focusing on human agency.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on human welfare. Moral codes include compassion, reason, and justice. Taboos involve harm and dogma.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 100â€“200 million adherents, primarily in Europe and the US. Growth is modest.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, valued for ethical teachings. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife; death is final. Focus is on earthly flourishing.[^15]
