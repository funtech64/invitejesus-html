## Introduction
Celtic religion, practiced by Celtic peoples in Europe (circa 500 BCE–500 CE), was a polytheistic tradition centered on deities like Lugh and Brigid, tied to nature and community. It is preserved in myths and archaeological records.
## View on God
Celtic religion was polytheistic and animistic, with gods like Lugh (light), Brigid (healing), and Cernunnos (nature). No single supreme deity; spirits inhabited landscapes and ancestors.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on harmony with nature, loyalty to tribe, and divine favor. Moral codes emphasized courage, hospitality, and ritual observance. Taboos included violating sacred groves or disrespecting gods.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 6th century CE. Historically practiced by millions in Britain, Ireland, and Gaul. Modern Druidry revivals number ~50,000–100,000 globally.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Celtic religion was replaced by Christianity, with some deities syncretized with saints (e.g., Brigid with St. Brigid). Jesus had no role in Celtic theology, but Christian missionaries adapted Celtic symbols and festivals.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved a blissful Otherworld, often an island or underground realm, where souls joined ancestors or gods. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured safe passage.[^19][^20]
