text# Native American Church
## Introduction
The Native American Church (NAC) is a syncretic religion founded in the late 19th century in the United States, blending indigenous spirituality with Christianity. It centers on peyote, a sacramental cactus, for spiritual communion.
## View on God
The NAC is monotheistic or animistic, worshiping the Great Spirit, often equated with the Christian God. Peyote is a sacred mediator, connecting practitioners to divine and ancestral spirits.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize harmony, respect, and community. Moral codes promote sobriety (outside peyote use), honesty, and family values, with peyote ceremonies fostering ethical reflection. Taboos include misuse of peyote and harming others.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 250,000–300,000 adherents, primarily among Native American tribes in the US (Navajo, Lakota) and Canada. Growth is stable, limited by legal restrictions on peyote.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The NAC integrates Christianity, viewing Jesus as a savior or spiritual figure alongside the Great Spirit. Many members blend Christian prayers with peyote rituals, creating a syncretic faith distinct from traditional Christianity.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often accessed through peyote visions. No clear heaven/hell; the focus is on spiritual harmony. Peyote ceremonies and songs ensure the soul’s peaceful transition and connection to ancestors.[^59][^60]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 94/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions). This completes the Indigenous American Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Pacific & Oceanic Religions (5 religions: Hawaiian, Māori, Aboriginal Dreamtime, John Frum, Polynesian traditions) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., African Traditional Religions) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 6 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Pacific & Oceanic Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!PleaseThanks for the continued excitement! I'll proceed with the Pacific & Oceanic Religions category, covering 5 religions: Hawaiian, Māori, Aboriginal Dreamtime, John Frum, and Polynesian Traditions. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., hawaiian.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 99/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to African Traditional Religions (e.g., Yoruba, Akan, Zulu, San, Serer) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
