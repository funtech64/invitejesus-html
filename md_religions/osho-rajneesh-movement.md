text# Osho/Rajneesh Movement
## Introduction
The Osho or Rajneesh movement is a spiritual movement founded in the 1960s by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) in India. It blends Hinduism, Buddhism, and Western spirituality, emphasizing meditation, freedom, and personal transformation.
## View on God
The movement is non-theistic or pantheistic, rejecting a personal God. Osho taught that divinity is within all beings, with enlightenment as the realization of this inner God. No external deities are central.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on individual freedom, awareness, and love. Moral codes promote meditation, nonviolence, and authenticity, with taboos against dogmatism and repression. Dynamic meditation and communal living foster ethical growth.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in India, the US, and Europe, centered around Osho’s Pune ashram. Growth is modest due to controversies surrounding Rajneesh’s leadership.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The movement views Jesus as an enlightened master, akin to Buddha or Osho, not divine. Christianity is respected as a spiritual path but seen as dogmatic. Osho’s teachings reinterpret Jesus’ compassion through an Eastern lens.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or dissolution into universal consciousness, based on spiritual awareness. No heaven/hell; enlightened souls merge with the divine, while others cycle through lives. Meditation practices prepare the soul for liberation.[^39][^40]
