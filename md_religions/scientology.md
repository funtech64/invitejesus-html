## Introduction
Scientology is a new religious movement founded in 1952 by L. Ron Hubbard in the United States. It emphasizes spiritual self-discovery through auditing (counseling) and a cosmology involving extraterrestrial origins, aiming to achieve a state of "Clear."
## View on God
Scientology is non-theistic, with no central concept of God. The Supreme Being is referenced vaguely as the "Eighth Dynamic," an infinite force of life. Practitioners focus on the thetan (soul) and personal enlightenment rather than deity worship.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal and collective survival across the Eight Dynamics (self, family, groups, etc.). Moral codes emphasize rationality, productivity, and avoiding harm, with auditing addressing ethical failings. Taboos include suppressing spiritual progress or opposing Scientology.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents globally, primarily in the US (California, Florida), with communities in Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Growth is limited due to controversy and high commitment levels.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Scientology has no direct engagement with Christianity, viewing it as a historical religion irrelevant to its cosmology. Jesus is seen as a historical figure, not divine, with no role in Scientology’s teachings. The church occasionally uses Christian symbols for outreach but remains distinct.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
Scientology believes the thetan is immortal, reincarnating across lifetimes. After death, the thetan may take a new body or remain in a spiritual state, aiming for higher states like Operating Thetan. No heaven/hell; auditing removes engrams (traumas) to prepare the thetan for future lives.[^29][^30]
