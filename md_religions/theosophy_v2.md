text# Theosophy
## Introduction
Theosophy, founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky in the US, is a spiritual movement blending Eastern and Western esotericism, emphasizing universal brotherhood and hidden knowledge.
## View on God
Theosophy is pantheistic, viewing divinity as an impersonal cosmic principle. No personal God; spiritual hierarchies (e.g., Masters) guide humanity.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on universal brotherhood and spiritual growth. Moral codes include compassion, truth, and self-discovery. Taboos involve selfishness and dogmatism.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000â€“50,000 adherents, primarily in the US, India, and Europe. Growth is limited due to its esoteric nature.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Theosophy views Jesus as an enlightened Master, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected as a partial truth within a broader spiritual framework.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation and spiritual evolution toward divine unity. No heaven/hell; meditation and study prepare the soul.[^5]
