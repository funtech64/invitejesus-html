text# Santhal & Tribal (Northeast India)
## Introduction
Santhal and tribal religions of Northeast India encompass the indigenous beliefs of groups like the Santhal, Khasi, and Munda, centered on animism, ancestor worship, and nature reverence. These traditions emphasize oral histories, rituals, and community cohesion.
## View on God
These religions are animistic and polytheistic, with no single God but spirits (bongas for Santhal) inhabiting nature, ancestors, and sacred sites. A supreme creator (e.g., Singbonga for Santhal) exists in some traditions but is distant, with spirits guiding daily life.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature and community. Moral codes emphasize respect for ancestors, sharing, and environmental stewardship. Taboos include harming sacred groves or disrespecting spirits. Rituals like sacrifices reinforce communal values.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 7–10 million adherents, primarily in Jharkhand, Odisha, and Northeast India (e.g., Assam, Meghalaya). Many (~60%) combine with Hinduism or Christianity; purely traditional adherents are declining due to modernization.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 19th-century missions, leading to syncretism in some communities (e.g., Khasi Christians blending animism). Jesus is often seen as a spiritual figure or healer, but traditionalists prioritize local spirits, viewing Christianity as secondary.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spirits joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to sacred landscapes. No heaven/hell; good lives lead to revered status, while evil causes unrest. Rituals like funeral dances ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral guidance.[^39][^40]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 22/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities). This completes the Indian Subcontinent Minorities category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to East Asian New Religions (7 religions: Cao Dai, Tenrikyo, Falun Gong, Onmyōdō, Ryukyuan religion, Cheondoism, Daejonggyo) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, I can do African Independent Movements (4 religions) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 4 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!Sounds goodAwesome, thanks for the go-ahead! I'll move forward with the East Asian New Religions category, covering 7 religions: Cao Dai, Tenrikyo, Falun Gong, Onmyōdō, Ryukyuan religion, Cheondoism, and Daejonggyo. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., cao-dai.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 29/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to African Independent Movements (4 religions) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category (e.g., Pagan & Revivalist Movements). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
