text# Shakers
## Introduction
Shakers, founded in the 18th century by Ann Lee in the US, are a Christian sect emphasizing communal living, celibacy, and spiritual purity.
## View on God
Shakers are monotheistic, worshiping one God with a dual (male-female) nature. Jesus embodies the male aspect.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on simplicity and equality. Moral codes include celibacy and work. Taboos involve selfishness.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 2â€“5 followers (nearly extinct), primarily in the US. Growth is negligible.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central, a divine figure alongside Mother Ann. Christianity is core, reinterpreted.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves heaven. No hell; worship prepares the soul.[^10]
