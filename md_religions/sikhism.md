text# Sikhism
## Introduction
Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak in Punjab, India. Based on the Guru Granth Sahib, it emphasizes devotion to one God, equality, and service, practiced through the Khalsa community.
## View on God
Sikhism is strictly monotheistic, worshiping Waheguru, the one supreme creator who is formless, eternal, and transcendent. No intermediaries or lesser deities exist; God is accessible through meditation and prayer.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are guided by the principles of truth, compassion, and humility. Moral codes include seva (selfless service), honesty, and equality, with the Khalsa code enforcing discipline. Taboos include casteism, intoxication, and harming others.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 25–30 million adherents (0.3% of global population), primarily in India (Punjab), with diaspora in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Growth is stable, driven by cultural identity.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Sikhism respects Jesus as a holy figure or teacher of compassion, but he is not divine or central. Sikhism’s monotheism and focus on the Guru Granth Sahib distinguish it from Christianity, with minimal historical interaction.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with souls cycling until achieving mukti (liberation), merging with Waheguru. No heaven/hell; good deeds and meditation (e.g., reciting Nitnem) prepare the soul for liberation.[^49][^50]
