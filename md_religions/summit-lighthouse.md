text# Summit Lighthouse
## Introduction
Summit Lighthouse, founded in 1958 by Mark and Elizabeth Prophet in the US, is a spiritual movement emphasizing Ascended Masters and spiritual teachings.
## View on God
The movement is monotheistic, viewing God as universal consciousness. Ascended Masters are guides.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual purity. Moral codes include devotion, meditation, and service. Taboos involve negativity.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an Ascended Master, not uniquely divine. Christianity is reinterpreted.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ascension or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^30]
