text# Happy Science
## Introduction
Happy Science (Kofuku-no-Kagaku), founded in 1986 by Ryuho Okawa in Japan, is a new religious movement emphasizing spiritual laws and enlightenment through teachings and meditation.
## View on God
Happy Science is monotheistic, worshiping El Cantare as the supreme spiritual being. Okawa is its incarnation.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and self-reflection. Moral codes include compassion and spiritual study. Taboos involve negativity.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 10 million claimed followers, primarily in Japan. Growth is modest.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or spiritual realms. No heaven/hell; teachings prepare the soul.[^15]
