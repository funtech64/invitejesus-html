text# Christian Science
## Introduction
Christian Science, founded in 1879 by Mary Baker Eddy in the US, is a religious movement emphasizing healing through prayer and divine understanding, based on *Science and Health*.
## View on God
Christian Science is monotheistic, worshiping God as an infinite, loving Spirit. God is Mind, Life, and Truth, not anthropomorphic.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual purity and healing. Moral codes include prayer, honesty, and compassion. Taboos involve materialism and reliance on medicine over prayer.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 adherents, primarily in the US and Europe. Declining due to modern medical preferences.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central, seen as the divine exemplar of God’s healing power. Christian Science reinterprets Christianity, emphasizing spiritual healing over traditional doctrines.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is spiritual, with souls progressing toward divine understanding. No literal heaven/hell; prayer prepares the soul for eternal harmony.[^5]
