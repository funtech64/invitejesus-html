text# Confucianism
## Introduction
Confucianism is a Chinese philosophical and spiritual tradition, founded by Confucius in the 5th century BCE. Based on texts like the *Analects*, it emphasizes ethical living, social harmony, and respect for tradition, often functioning as a quasi-religion.
## View on God
Confucianism is non-theistic, with no personal God. Heaven (Tian) is an impersonal cosmic order or moral force guiding human affairs. Ancestors and spirits are revered but not worshipped as deities.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on ren (benevolence), li (ritual propriety), and xiao (filial piety). Moral codes emphasize respect, loyalty, and social harmony, with rituals reinforcing values. Taboos include disrespecting elders or disrupting social order.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 5â€“10 million practice religious Confucianism, primarily in China, Korea, and Vietnam, with millions more following its philosophy. Declining as a religion due to secularism, but influential culturally.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Confucianism has limited engagement with Christianity. Jesus is seen as a moral teacher, akin to Confucius, but not divine. Some Confucian-Christian syncretism exists in Korea, but Confucianism remains distinct.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is de-emphasized; the focus is on earthly harmony. Some believe in a spiritual realm where ancestors reside, with no heaven/hell. Rituals like ancestor veneration ensure familial continuity, not afterlife preparation.[^19][^20]
