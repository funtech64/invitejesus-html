text# Māori Traditional Religion
## Introduction
Māori traditional religion is the indigenous spirituality of the Māori people of New Zealand, focusing on a pantheon of gods, ancestors, and a deep connection to the land and sea. It is expressed through oral histories, rituals, and cultural practices like haka and karakia (prayers).
## View on God
Māori religion is polytheistic, with gods (atua) governing aspects of nature and human life, such as Tāne (forest and birds), Tangaroa (sea), and Ranginui (sky father). Io Matua Kore, a supreme creator in some traditions, is less central. Spirits and ancestors (wairua) also hold divine significance, linking the living to the spiritual world.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize harmony with nature, respect for ancestors, and communal responsibility. Moral codes include utu (reciprocity), tapu (sacredness), and mana (spiritual authority). Taboos govern interactions with sacred sites or objects, with violations requiring ritual restoration. Karakia reinforce ethical living.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000-100,000 Māori (10-15% of ~700,000 Māori in New Zealand) actively practice traditional beliefs, often alongside Christianity. Most Māori are Christian (~50%), with traditional practices declining but resurging through cultural revitalization efforts.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread among Māori via 19th-century missionaries, leading to syncretism in movements like Ringatū and Rātana, which blend Māori spirituality with Christian elements. Jesus is sometimes seen as a prophetic figure or tapu leader, akin to a tohunga (priest). Traditionalists may prioritize atua over Jesus, viewing Christianity as compatible but secondary.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the wairua (spirit) journeying to the spiritual realm, often Hawaiki, the ancestral homeland. Spirits may linger near sacred sites or join ancestors, guiding the living. There is no heaven/hell; the focus is on maintaining spiritual connections through rituals like tangihanga (funerals), which ensure the spirit’s peaceful departure.[^19][^20]
