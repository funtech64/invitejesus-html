text# Gnosticism (Modern Revivals)
## Introduction
Modern Gnosticism is a revival of ancient Gnostic traditions (1st–4th century CE), emerging in the 19th–20th centuries. It emphasizes esoteric knowledge (gnosis) for spiritual liberation, blending Christian, Jewish, and mystical elements.
## View on God
Gnosticism is dualistic or monistic, with a supreme, unknowable God (the Monad) above a flawed demiurge (often equated with the Old Testament God). Jesus or Sophia (wisdom) reveals divine truth, opposing the demiurge’s material world.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on seeking gnosis, rejecting materialism, and cultivating compassion. Moral codes emphasize spiritual purity and wisdom, with taboos against ignorance and worldly attachments. Practices like meditation aid liberation.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–30,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and online communities, often within New Age or esoteric groups. Growth is modest due to its intellectual nature.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Modern Gnosticism engages deeply with Christianity, viewing Jesus as a divine revealer of gnosis, not merely the Son of God. Some see him as opposing the demiurge, with texts like the Gospel of Thomas central. Gnosticism diverges from orthodox Christianity’s focus on faith.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul’s liberation from the material world to rejoin the Monad in the Pleroma (divine fullness). Unenlightened souls may reincarnate or remain trapped. No eternal hell; gnosis rituals prepare the soul for ascent through spiritual realms.[^59][^60]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 49/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult). This completes the Esoteric & Occult category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to New Religious Movements (14 religions: Bahá’í Faith, Unification Church, Scientology, Raëlism, Eckankar, Church of All Worlds, Church of the SubGenius, Discordianism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Nation of Yahweh, Children of God, Heaven’s Gate, Aetherius Society). This is a larger category, so I can split it into two batches (~7 each) to stay within limits. Alternatively, I can start Umbrella-Claimant Cults (12 religions) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 6 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., split New Religious Movements into two).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!I keep checking them and they’re good!! Please keep goingThrilled to hear the files are hitting the mark! I'll continue with the New Religious Movements category, covering the first 7 of 14 religions to keep the batch manageable: Bahá’í Faith, Unification Church, Scientology, Raëlism, Eckankar, Church of All Worlds, and Church of the SubGenius. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., bahai-faith.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 56/140 articles toward your goal. The remaining 7 New Religious Movements (Discordianism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Nation of Yahweh, Children of God, Heaven’s Gate, Aetherius Society) can be covered in the next batch, followed by Umbrella-Claimant Cults (12 religions) or another category of your choice. Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
