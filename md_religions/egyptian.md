## Introduction
Ancient Egyptian religion, practiced from circa 3000–300 BCE, was a polytheistic tradition centered on deities controlling cosmic and earthly forces. It influenced Mediterranean cultures through its myths, art, and rituals.
## View on God
Egyptian religion was polytheistic, with gods like Ra (sun), Osiris (death), and Isis (magic). No single supreme deity; gods were interconnected, embodying natural and social forces.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on ma’at (order, justice), with moral codes emphasizing truth, loyalty, and offerings to gods. Taboos included chaos (isfet) and neglecting divine or royal duties.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 4th century CE. Historically practiced by millions in ancient Egypt. Modern Kemetic revivals number fewer than 20,000 globally.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Egyptian religion predates Christianity but influenced it through Hellenistic culture (e.g., Isis worship and Christian Mariology). Jesus had no role in Egyptian theology, though early Christians adopted Egyptian symbols like the ankh.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved judgment in the Hall of Ma’at, where the heart was weighed against a feather. The righteous entered the Field of Reeds, a paradise; the wicked were devoured. Rituals like mummification and spells prepared the soul for eternal life.[^29][^30]
