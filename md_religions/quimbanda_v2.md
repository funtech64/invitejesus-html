## Introduction
Hawaiian religion is the traditional spiritual tradition of Native Hawaiians, centered on gods like Kāne (creator) and Pele (volcano goddess), emphasizing harmony with nature and ancestors. It involves oral myths, hula dances, and rituals at heiau (temples) to maintain mana (spiritual power). Suppressed during colonization, it persists in cultural practices like lei-making and offerings, often blended with Christianity.
## View on God
Hawaiian religion is polytheistic, venerating gods like Kāne, Lono (fertility), and Kū (war). Divinity is immanent in nature, with aumakua (ancestral spirits) guiding families.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on pono (righteousness) and aloha (love). Moral codes include respect for nature, community, and rituals. Taboos (kapu) involve violating sacred sites or mana.
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 followers, primarily in Hawaii, with many blending with Christianity. Growth is tied to Native Hawaiian revival efforts.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a healer or spirit. Christianity, introduced by missionaries, is widely integrated, with Hawaiian gods equated to saints.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves Po (underworld) or ancestral realms, with reincarnation possible. No heaven or hell; rituals like funerals ensure the soul's peaceful journey and continued guidance.
