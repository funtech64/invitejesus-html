text# Candomblé
## Introduction
Candomblé is a syncretic religion originating in Brazil during the 19th century, blending Yoruba orisha worship with Catholicism and indigenous elements. It emphasizes rituals, dance, and spiritual connection to orixás.
## View on God
Candomblé is polytheistic with a monotheistic undertone, worshiping Olodumare (Olorun) as the supreme creator, distant and transcendent. Orixás (e.g., Iemanjá, Oxóssi) are divine intermediaries, syncretized with Catholic saints.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community, respect for orixás, and spiritual harmony. Moral codes emphasize reciprocity, charity, and ritual observance, with divination guiding ethical choices. Taboos include disrespecting orixás or violating ritual purity.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 2–5 million adherents, primarily in Brazil (Bahia, Rio de Janeiro), with communities in the US and Europe. Growth is steady, driven by cultural revival, though limited by Christian dominance.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Candomblé integrates Catholicism, equating Jesus with orixás like Oxalá (peace, purity) or as a divine figure. Practitioners often participate in Catholic rituals, blending Christian elements with orixá worship. Jesus is revered but not central.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors or orixás in Orun, with reincarnation possible based on deeds. No heaven/hell; rituals like axexê (funerals) ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral connection.[^29][^30]
