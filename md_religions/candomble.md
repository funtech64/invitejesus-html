# Candomblé

## Introduction
Candomblé is an Afro-Brazilian religion that originated from Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu traditions brought by enslaved Africans to Brazil, syncretized with Roman Catholicism. It focuses on worship of orixás (deities) through dance, music, and offerings to maintain spiritual balance and community harmony.

## View on God
Candomblé is polytheistic with a supreme creator, Olodumare (or Olorun), who is distant and delegates authority to orixás—divine beings representing natural forces and human archetypes (e.g., Exu as messenger, Oxum as love and fertility, Xangô as justice). Orixás are intermediaries, each person linked to one or more through initiation, embodying aspects of the divine.[^13][^14]

## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize respect for nature, community, and orixás. Moral codes promote harmony (axé), charity, and avoidance of harm, guided by proverbs and divination. Taboos include disrespecting elders or sacred sites, with rituals reinforcing virtues like humility and reciprocity.[^15][^16]

## Demographics
Approximately 2-4 million adherents globally, mainly in Brazil (especially Bahia, where it's practiced by up to 20% of the population), with diaspora communities in the US, Europe, and Latin America. Growth is stable but faces stigma; many practice alongside Christianity.[^17][^18]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Candomblé developed under colonial oppression, blending African traditions with Catholicism to survive. Orixás are syncretized with saints (e.g., Iemanjá with Virgin Mary, Ogum with Saint George). Jesus is viewed as a powerful spiritual figure or orixá equivalent (e.g., Oxalá), with rituals incorporating Christian prayers. This allows dual affiliation, though some see conflict with monotheism.[^19][^20]

## View on Afterlife
Death is a transition to the ancestral realm (Orun), where the soul (emi) joins orixás and ancestors. Good lives lead to revered status and reincarnation; evil causes unrest. No strict heaven/hell; ancestors influence the living, honored through rituals like egungun festivals for communication and harmony.[^21][^22]
