text# Wicca (Eclectic)
## Introduction
Eclectic Wicca, emerging in the 20th century, is a neo-pagan religion blending various Wiccan traditions, emphasizing personal spirituality and flexible rituals.
## View on God
Eclectic Wicca is polytheistic, worshiping a Goddess and God or multiple deities, tailored to individual belief. Divinity is immanent.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics follow the Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will." Moral codes emphasize freedom, nature, and personal growth. Taboos involve harm.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is steady due to its flexibility.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often distanced due to historical conflicts.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or a Summerland realm. No heaven/hell; personal rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
