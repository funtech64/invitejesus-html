## Introduction
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith in the United States, is a restorationist Christian movement. It emphasizes additional scriptures (Book of Mormon) and modern prophets.
## View on God
LDS is monotheistic, worshiping God the Father as a distinct, exalted being with a physical body. The Trinity is three separate beings: God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost. Humans can become gods through eternal progression.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on family, chastity, and obedience to God’s commandments. Moral codes include tithing, Word of Wisdom (health code), and charity. Taboos include premarital sex, alcohol, and disobedience to church authority.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 16–17 million adherents globally, primarily in the US (Utah), Latin America, and the Philippines. Growth is strong due to missionary work and high birth rates.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
LDS identifies as Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God, savior, and central to atonement. The Book of Mormon and modern prophets supplement the Bible, distinguishing LDS from mainstream Christianity, which often disputes its Christian status.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a three-tiered heaven (Celestial, Terrestrial, Telestial kingdoms), with the righteous attaining the Celestial Kingdom to live with God. The wicked face Outer Darkness, but few are damned eternally. Temple ordinances like sealing prepare believers for exaltation and godhood.[^19][^20]
