text# Meher Baba Movement
## Introduction
The Meher Baba Movement, founded in the 1920s by Meher Baba in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing divine love and universal spirituality. Meher Baba, considered an avatar, taught that all religions lead to God through love and service. Centers in India, the US, and Australia offer meditation, retreats, and charity work. The movement appeals to seekers of mystical unity, blending Sufi, Hindu, and Christian elements, with Baba’s silence as a hallmark.
## View on God
The movement is monistic, viewing God as the infinite reality within all, manifest across religions.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and surrender. Moral codes include compassion, truth, and service. Taboos involve egoism and materialism, blocking divine connection.
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is modest through centers.[^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an avatar, equal to Meher Baba. Christianity is respected as a valid spiritual path.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation. No heaven or hell; love and meditation prepare the soul for divine union.
