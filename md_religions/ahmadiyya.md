text# Ahmadiyya
## Introduction
Ahmadiyya is an Islamic movement founded in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in India. It emphasizes the revival of Islam and claims Ahmad as the promised Messiah and Mahdi, causing controversy among mainstream Muslims.
## View on God
Ahmadiyya is strictly monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the one true God, as in mainstream Islam. No intermediaries exist; Allah is transcendent and omnipotent, revealed through prophets, including Ahmad.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics align with Islamic principles, emphasizing submission to Allah, charity, and peace. Moral codes include the Five Pillars, honesty, and community service. Taboos include idolatry, immorality, and rejecting Ahmad’s prophethood.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 10–20 million adherents, primarily in Pakistan, India, and Africa (e.g., Nigeria, Ghana), with diaspora in the UK and US. Growth is strong but faces persecution in Muslim-majority countries.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Ahmadiyya views Jesus as a prophet, not divine, who survived crucifixion and died naturally in India (per Ahmad’s teachings). Christianity is respected as a divine religion, but Ahmadiyya claims to fulfill its prophecies through Ahmad’s messianic role.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic eschatology, with souls judged on Judgment Day. The righteous enter Jannah (paradise), a realm of eternal bliss, while the wicked face Jahannam (hell), with potential for redemption. Prayer and good deeds prepare believers for paradise.[^59][^60]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 69/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 6 Umbrella-Claimant Cults). This completes half of the Umbrella-Claimant Cults category.
Next Category: I recommend completing the Umbrella-Claimant Cults category with the remaining 6 religions (Nation of Islam, Alawites, Nichiren Shōshū/Soka Gakkai, Osho/Rajneesh movement, Aum Shinrikyo, ISKCON/Hare Krishna, Sathya Sai Baba movement) in the next batch. After that, we can revisit categories for expansion (e.g., adding major religions like Christianity or Islam, or deepening afterlife details for smaller groups) or start a new one.
Batch Size: This batch had 6 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., all 6 for the remaining Umbrella-Claimant Cults).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., finish Umbrella-Claimant Cults) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Yes pleaseAwesome, let's keep rolling! I'll complete the Umbrella-Claimant Cults category with the remaining 6 religions: Nation of Islam, Alawites, Nichiren Shōshū/Soka Gakkai, Osho/Rajneesh Movement, Aum Shinrikyo, and ISKCON/Hare Krishna. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., nation-of-islam.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 75/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest starting a new category, such as Major Religions (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism) to cover core faiths, or we can revisit smaller categories for deeper detail (e.g., more afterlife focus). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
