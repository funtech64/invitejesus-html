# Haitian Vodou

## Introduction
Haitian Vodou is an Afro-Haitian religion blending West African (especially Fon and Yoruba) traditions with Roman Catholicism and indigenous Ta√≠no elements. It emerged from enslaved Africans in Haiti, emphasizing spirit worship through rituals, music, and possession for healing and guidance.

## View on God
Vodou is monotheistic with polytheistic practices. The supreme creator is Bondye (from French "Bon Dieu"), a distant, benevolent God who does not intervene directly. Bondye delegates to lwa (spirits), intermediaries embodying forces like Papa Legba (gatekeeper) and Erzulie (love). Lwa are honored as accessible divine aspects.[^33][^34]

## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community harmony, respect for lwa, and moral balance. Virtues include reciprocity, justice, and charity; taboos avoid disrespecting spirits or harming others. Divination and rituals guide ethical behavior, emphasizing personal responsibility and communal support.[^35][^36]

## Demographics
Approximately 2-5 million adherents globally, primarily in Haiti (50-80% practice in syncretic forms), with diaspora in the US (especially Florida, New York), Canada, and France. Growth is stable but stigmatized; many combine with Christianity.[^37][^38]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Vodou syncretized with Catholicism under slavery, equating lwa with saints (e.g., Ezili Dantor with Black Madonna). Jesus is viewed as a powerful lwa or spiritual figure, with rituals incorporating Christian prayers and symbols. Dual practice is common, though some Christians reject it as incompatible.[^39][^40][^41]

## View on Afterlife
Death is a transition to the ancestral realm (Ginen), where the soul (gwo bon anj) joins lwa and ancestors, influencing the living. Good lives lead to honored status; unresolved issues cause unrest. No heaven/hell; rituals ensure peaceful passage and ongoing communication with spirits.[^42][^43]
