text# Haitian Vodou
## Introduction
Haitian Vodou, developed in Haiti among African descendants, is a syncretic religion blending West African Vodun with Catholicism, emphasizing spirits (lwa) and rituals.
## View on God
Vodou is monotheistic, worshiping Bondye as the supreme creator, with lwa like Legba as intermediaries.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect, offerings, and rituals. Taboos involve disrespecting lwa.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million followers, primarily in Haiti and the diaspora (US, Canada). Growth is steady.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a lwa or divine figure. Christianity is deeply integrated.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^5]
