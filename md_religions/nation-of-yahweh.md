text# Nation of Yahweh
## Introduction
The Nation of Yahweh is a religious movement founded in 1979 by Hulon Mitchell Jr. (Yahweh ben Yahweh) in the United States. Rooted in Black Hebrew Israelite theology, it emphasizes African-American empowerment and divine identity as the true Israelites.
## View on God
The Nation of Yahweh is monotheistic, worshiping Yahweh as the one true God. Yahweh ben Yahweh is seen as a divine messiah, guiding followers to their divine heritage. No lesser deities are recognized.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on racial pride, discipline, and obedience to Yahweh’s laws. Moral codes emphasize community unity, purity, and adherence to biblical commandments, reinterpreted for African-Americans. Taboos include assimilation into "white" culture and sin.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 adherents, primarily in the US (Florida, Georgia). Declining since the 1990s due to legal controversies and the founder’s death.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Nation of Yahweh rejects mainstream Christianity, viewing it as a corrupted religion. Jesus is seen as a false or misunderstood figure, with Yahweh ben Yahweh as the true messiah. The movement uses biblical texts but reinterprets them through a Black Israelite lens.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife aligns with a modified Christian eschatology, with the righteous (true Israelites) entering a divine kingdom, often seen as a restored Israel. The wicked face judgment or exclusion. No eternal hell is emphasized; rituals focus on earthly empowerment for divine destiny.[^39][^40]
