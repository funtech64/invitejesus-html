text# Aboriginal Dreamtime
## Introduction
Aboriginal Dreamtime, the spiritual tradition of Indigenous Australians, encompasses *Dreamings*—creation stories explaining the land, laws, and life. It involves songlines, ceremonies like *corroborees*, and art to transmit cultural knowledge across generations. Suppressed during colonization, it persists through revival efforts in remote communities and urban art. Sacred sites like Uluru are central, reflecting a profound connection to the land and ancestors, often blended with Christianity in modern contexts.
## View on God
Aboriginal Dreamtime is polytheistic, venerating ancestor beings like the Rainbow Serpent and Wandjina. Divinity is immanent in the land and creation stories.
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on *Tjukurpa* (law) and kinship. Moral codes include respect for elders, land stewardship, and rituals. Taboos involve violating sacred sites or cultural laws.
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000–700,000 followers, primarily in Australia, with many blending with Christianity. Growth is tied to Indigenous cultural revival.[^11]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as an ancestor or spirit. Christianity, introduced by missionaries, is integrated in many communities, with Dreamtime stories complementing biblical narratives.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves returning to the Dreamtime or ancestral realms. No heaven or hell; ceremonies like funerals ensure the soul’s return to the land.
