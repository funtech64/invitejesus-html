text# Eckankar
## Introduction
Eckankar is a new religious movement founded in 1965 by Paul Twitchell in the United States. It emphasizes spiritual freedom, soul travel, and direct experience of God through meditation and chanting, blending Hindu and Western esoteric elements.
## View on God
Eckankar is monotheistic, worshiping Sugmad, the infinite divine source of all life. Sugmad is accessed through spiritual guides (Eck Masters), with no lesser deities. The divine is immanent, present in all souls.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual growth, love, and freedom. Moral codes emphasize truth, nonviolence, and service, with practices like chanting "HU" fostering ethical living. Taboos include harming others or obstructing spiritual progress.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and Africa (e.g., Nigeria). Growth is modest due to its esoteric focus.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Eckankar views Jesus as an Eck Master, a spiritual guide who attained divine consciousness, not the unique Son of God. It respects Christian teachings but prioritizes its own cosmology, with minimal syncretism.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
Eckankar believes in reincarnation, with the soul cycling through lives to achieve spiritual liberation (God-realization). After death, souls enter spiritual planes, progressing toward Sugmad. No heaven/hell; soul travel and meditation prepare the soul for higher realms.[^49][^50]
