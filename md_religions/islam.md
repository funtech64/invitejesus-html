text# Islam
## Introduction
Islam is a monotheistic religion founded in the 7th century CE by the Prophet Muhammad in Arabia. Based on the Quran and Hadith, it emphasizes submission to God’s will and is practiced through Sunni, Shia, and other sects.
## View on God
Islam is strictly monotheistic, worshiping Allah, the one, omnipotent, and transcendent creator. No partners or intermediaries exist; Allah is unique, as described in the Quran’s Tawhid principle.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, emphasizing justice, compassion, and submission to Allah. Moral codes include the Five Pillars (faith, prayer, charity, fasting, pilgrimage), honesty, and modesty. Taboos include idolatry, murder, and usury.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 1.9 billion adherents (25% of global population), primarily in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and Indonesia. Growth is strong, driven by high birth rates and conversions.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Islam respects Jesus (Isa) as a prophet and messenger of Allah, born of the Virgin Mary, but not divine or part of a Trinity. Christianity is seen as a predecessor religion, with some truths but corrupted scriptures. Muslims reject Jesus’ crucifixion and divinity.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves Judgment Day, when souls are judged based on deeds. The righteous enter Jannah (paradise), a realm of eternal bliss with gardens and rivers. The wicked face Jahannam (hell), with potential for redemption in some interpretations. Practices like prayer and charity prepare believers for paradise.[^19][^20]
