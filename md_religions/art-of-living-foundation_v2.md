text# Art of Living Foundation
## Introduction
The Art of Living Foundation, founded in 1981 by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in India, is a spiritual movement promoting Sudarshan Kriya (breathing techniques) for stress relief and spiritual growth. Blending Vedic traditions with universal spirituality, it offers workshops, meditation, and humanitarian projects worldwide. The foundation emphasizes inner peace and service, appealing to diverse audiences seeking holistic well-being. Centers in over 150 countries foster community and personal transformation through yoga and breathing practices.
## View on God
The Foundation is non-theistic, viewing divinity as universal consciousness, not a personal god, accessible through meditation.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on peace and service. Moral codes include nonviolence, compassion, and truth. Taboos involve harm and negativity, obstructing spiritual clarity.
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is strong through global programs.[^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual master, respected for love and compassion. Christianity is seen as a valid path, compatible with the Foundation’s universalism.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or spiritual liberation, rooted in Vedic thought. No heaven or hell; practices focus on present-life harmony.
