text# Daejonggyo
## Introduction
Daejonggyo, or Dangun worship, is a Korean religion founded in the early 20th century, centered on the veneration of Dangun, the mythical founder of Korea (2333 BCE). It blends nationalism, shamanism, and reverence for a divine ancestor.
## View on God
Daejonggyo is monotheistic, worshiping Hanulnim (Heavenly God), with Dangun as a divine-human intermediary. Hanulnim is the supreme creator, and Dangun’s lineage connects Koreans to the divine.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize national pride, harmony, and respect for ancestors. Moral codes promote loyalty, filial piety, and community welfare, with rituals reinforcing Korean identity. Taboos include disrespecting Dangun or national heritage.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 adherents, primarily in South Korea, with small groups in North Korea and diaspora (US, Japan). Declining due to secularization and competition with Christianity.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Daejonggyo is tied to Korean nationalism, with minimal Christian engagement. Jesus is not referenced, though some view him as a foreign spiritual figure. Christianity is seen as a competing influence, with Daejonggyo emphasizing indigenous identity.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves joining ancestors in a spiritual realm under Hanulnim, with no clear heaven/hell. Souls may reincarnate or guide descendants, with rituals like ancestral offerings ensuring harmony.[^69][^70]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 29/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions). This completes the East Asian New Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to African Independent Movements (4 religions: Kimbanguism, Aladura churches, Zion Christian Church, Rastafarianism) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, I can do Pagan & Revivalist Movements (8 religions) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 7 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!Sounds goodGreat, thanks for the confirmation! I'll proceed with the African Independent Movements category, covering 4 religions: Kimbanguism, Aladura Churches, Zion Christian Church, and Rastafarianism. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., kimbanguism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail). Historical details included as these are Abrahamic-adjacent.
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics, history, and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 33/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Pagan & Revivalist Movements (8 religions) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category (e.g., Syncretic & Ayahuasca). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
