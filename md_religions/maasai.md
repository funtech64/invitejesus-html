text# Maasai Religion
## Introduction
Maasai religion is the traditional belief system of the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania, centered on a single deity, ancestors, and pastoral life. It emphasizes rituals, oral traditions, and harmony with the environment.
## View on God
Maasai religion is monotheistic, with Enkai (or Ngai), the supreme creator, governing life and nature. Enkai has dual aspects: benevolent (Enkai Narok, black) and punitive (Enkai Nanyokie, red). Ancestors and spirits mediate divine will.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on respect for Enkai, elders, and cattle (central to Maasai life). Moral codes promote bravery, loyalty, and communal support, with taboos against harming sacred animals or spaces. Rituals guide ethical behavior.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 1-2 million Maasai practice traditional religion, primarily in Kenya and Tanzania. Many (~60%) combine it with Christianity or Islam; purely traditional adherents are declining due to modernization.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 20th-century missions, with Enkai sometimes equated with the Christian God. Jesus is viewed as a spiritual figure but not central; traditionalists prioritize Enkai and ancestors, often resisting full conversion.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm under Enkaiâ€™s domain. Good lives ensure ancestral status; evil leads to unrest. No heaven/hell; rituals like sacrifices maintain spiritual connections.[^59][^60]
