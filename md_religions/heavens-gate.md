text# Heaven’s Gate
## Introduction
Heaven’s Gate was a UFO-based religious movement founded in the 1970s by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles in the United States. It blended Christian and extraterrestrial beliefs, culminating in a mass suicide in 1997 to ascend to a spacecraft.
## View on God
Heaven’s Gate was monotheistic, worshiping a cosmic God tied to extraterrestrial beings (the Next Level). Jesus was seen as a Next Level representative, with Applewhite as his successor. God is a higher intelligence guiding evolution.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on transcending human desires for ascension. Moral codes emphasized celibacy, discipline, and detachment from materialism. Taboos included earthly attachments and doubting the Next Level’s plan.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
No active adherents remain since the 1997 suicide of 39 members. At its peak, it had ~200 members in the US. The movement is extinct but historically significant.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Heaven’s Gate reinterpreted Christianity, viewing Jesus as an extraterrestrial emissary who returned as Applewhite. Christian scriptures were used selectively, with the movement claiming to fulfill biblical prophecy through ascension to the Next Level.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved physical ascension to the Next Level, a higher plane of existence aboard a spacecraft. Souls shed human bodies to join this realm, with no heaven/hell. Rituals like fasting and group living prepared members for this transition.[^59][^60]
