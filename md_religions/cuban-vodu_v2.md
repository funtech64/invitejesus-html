text# Cuban Vodú
## Introduction
Cuban Vodú is a syncretic religion blending West African Vodun with Catholicism, developed among slaves in Cuba, focusing on spirits and rituals.
## View on God
Cuban Vodú is monotheistic, worshiping Bondye as supreme, with lwa as intermediaries.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and harmony. Moral codes include respect and offerings. Taboos involve disrespecting lwa.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000–1 million followers, primarily in Cuba and diaspora. Growth is modest.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a lwa. Christianity is integrated.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
