text# ISKCON/Hare Krishna
## Introduction
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), or Hare Krishna, is a Hindu-based movement founded in 1966 by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in the US. It emphasizes devotion to Krishna through chanting and vegetarianism.
## View on God
ISKCON is monotheistic, worshiping Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with other Hindu deities (e.g., Vishnu, Radha) as aspects or associates. Krishna is eternal, personal, and accessible through bhakti (devotion).[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on devotion, purity, and service to Krishna. Moral codes include vegetarianism, chastity, and humility, with chanting the Hare Krishna mantra fostering spiritual growth. Taboos include meat-eating, intoxication, and illicit sex.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million adherents globally, primarily in India, the US, Europe, and Russia. Growth is steady due to missionary work and cultural appeal.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
ISKCON respects Jesus as a spiritual teacher or shaktyavesha avatar (empowered by God), not divine. Christianity is seen as a valid path but subordinate to Krishna devotion. Some ISKCON members integrate Christian ethics into their practice.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with the soul cycling through lives until achieving liberation (moksha) through devotion to Krishna. Liberated souls enter Goloka Vrindavan, Krishna’s spiritual realm, while the wicked face lower rebirths. Chanting and devotional practices prepare the soul for liberation.[^59][^60]
