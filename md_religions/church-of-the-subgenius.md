text# Church of the SubGenius
## Introduction
The Church of the SubGenius is a satirical, parody religion founded in 1979 by Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond in the US. It uses absurdist humor to critique mainstream culture, centering on "Bob" Dobbs, a fictional prophet, and a sci-fi cosmology.
## View on God
The Church is non-theistic or parodic, with no serious belief in a deity. "JHVH-1" is a satirical stand-in for God, while "Bob" Dobbs is a symbolic figure of rebellion. The divine is a humorous construct, not a literal belief.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are tongue-in-cheek, promoting "slack" (freedom from societal pressure) and creativity. Moral codes mockingly encourage nonconformity and humor, with taboos against taking life too seriously. Practices are performative, like "devivals."[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 adherents, primarily in the US, with small online communities. Growth is limited due to its satirical nature.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Church parodies Christianity, using Jesus as a humorous archetype or "SubGenius saint" alongside "Bob." No serious engagement exists; Jesus is mocked as part of broader religious satire, not revered.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is a satirical concept, with "Bob" promising a spaceship to escape Earth’s destruction by aliens (X-ists). No serious beliefs; some jest about reincarnation or eternal "slack." Rituals are playful, not preparatory for an afterlife.[^69][^70]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 56/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 7 New Religious Movements). This completes half of the New Religious Movements category.
Next Category: I recommend completing the New Religious Movements category with the remaining 7 religions (Discordianism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Nation of Yahweh, Children of God, Heaven’s Gate, Aetherius Society) in the next batch. After that, I can move to Umbrella-Claimant Cults (12 religions, which can be split into two batches) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 7 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., all 7 for the remaining New Religious Movements).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., finish New Religious Movements) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Please continueThanks for the continued enthusiasm! I'll complete the New Religious Movements category with the remaining 7 religions: Discordianism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Nation of Yahweh, Children of God (Family International), Heaven’s Gate, and Aetherius Society. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., discordianism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 63/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Umbrella-Claimant Cults (12 religions, which I can split into two batches of ~6) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category. Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
