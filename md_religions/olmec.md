text# Olmec
## Introduction
Olmec religion, practiced in Mesoamerica (circa 1500–400 BCE), was an early polytheistic tradition influencing later cultures like the Maya and Aztec. Centered on nature deities, it is known from archaeological evidence.
## View on God
Olmec religion was polytheistic and animistic, with deities like the Olmec Dragon (earth) and Jaguar God (rain). No single supreme God; spirits were tied to nature and cosmology.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on cosmic harmony and ritual offerings. Moral codes likely emphasized community and respect for deities, inferred from art and architecture. Taboos included disrupting sacred order.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by 400 BCE. Historically practiced by thousands in Mexico’s Gulf Coast. Modern revivals are negligible.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Olmec religion predates Christianity by centuries, with no direct contact. Post-conquest, some Mesoamerican descendants blended Christian figures like Jesus with local deities, but Olmec theology had no role for Jesus.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is poorly documented but likely involved a spiritual realm where souls joined ancestors or deities. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured cosmic continuity.[^29][^30]
