text# Druidry (OBOD)
## Introduction
Druidry (Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids), founded in 1964 in the UK, is a neo-pagan movement reviving Celtic spirituality, emphasizing nature and creativity.
## View on God
OBOD Druidry is pantheistic or polytheistic, revering nature’s spirits or deities like Cerridwen. Divinity is immanent in the earth.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature. Moral codes include environmentalism, creativity, and respect. Taboos involve harm and disconnection.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 followers, primarily in the UK and US. Growth is modest, tied to neo-paganism.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical or mythic figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but distinct from Druidry’s nature focus.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or an Otherworld. No heaven/hell; rituals connect souls to nature.[^25]
