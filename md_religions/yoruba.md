# Yoruba Religion

## Introduction
Yoruba religion is an indigenous African tradition originating among the Yoruba people of West Africa, emphasizing a hierarchy of deities, ancestor veneration, and harmony with nature. It often blends with Christianity or Islam in syncretic forms.

## View on God
The supreme creator is Olodumare (or Olorun), an omnipotent, transcendent being who delegates authority to lesser deities called orisha (e.g., 400+ spirits like Orunmila for wisdom, Oshun for fertility). God is not anthropomorphic but manifests through nature and orisha, who act as intermediaries. Polytheistic elements coexist with a monotheistic supreme entity.[^11][^12]

## View on Afterlife
Death is not the end but a transformation. The soul (emi) continues, with ancestors influencing the living. Good lives lead to reincarnation or ancestral status; evil may result in unrest or punishment. Rituals ensure peaceful transition, with no strict heaven/hell but a spiritual realm where the dead interact with descendants. In greater detail, the Yoruba concept of the afterlife, known as Oku, views death as a transition to the spiritual realm called ara orun or Ikole Orun (Heaven). The soul, or emi, is the breath of life bestowed by Olodumare, and upon death, it separates from the body. Reincarnation, termed Atunwa, is a key belief, often occurring within the family lineage, as reflected in names like Babatunde ("father returns") or Yetunde ("mother returns"). This rebirth carries accumulated wisdom from previous lives, with one aspect of the soul (the Guardian Ori) returning to earth while another remains in the ancestral realm. Ancestors, or egun, reside in ara orun and continue to guide and protect the living, influencing daily affairs through blessings or interventions. Evil deeds may lead to spiritual unrest or denial of ancestral status, preventing reincarnation. Rituals, such as the Egungun masquerade festivals, honor ancestors and facilitate communication, involving costumes, dances, and offerings to maintain harmony between the living and the dead.[^13][^14][^15]

## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize communal harmony, virtues like love, temperance, honesty, honor, and morality. Moral codes derive from orisha teachings and proverbs, promoting respect for elders, truthfulness, and balance (iwapele). Taboos (eewo) guide behavior, with divination (Ifá) advising ethical paths.[^16][^17]

## Demographics
Approximately 20-40 million adherents globally, primarily in Nigeria (Yorubaland, ~20 million Yoruba people), Benin, Togo, and diaspora communities in the Americas (e.g., Brazil, Cuba via syncretic forms like Santería/Candomblé). Growth is stable but declining due to conversion to Christianity/Islam; ~10-15% of Yoruba practice purely traditional forms.[^18][^19]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Yoruba religion has interacted extensively with Christianity, particularly through historical missionary influences in West Africa and syncretism in diaspora communities. In traditional Yoruba contexts, many adherents have converted to Christianity, leading to a decline in purely indigenous practices, though elements like orisha veneration often persist alongside Christian beliefs. Christianity is sometimes viewed as a complementary or alternative system, with some Yoruba interpreting biblical figures through indigenous lenses. In diaspora forms, such as Santería (in Cuba and the Caribbean) and Candomblé (in Brazil), Yoruba religion has blended with Roman Catholicism due to historical enslavement and forced conversions. This syncretism equates Christian saints and figures with orishas: for example, Jesus Christ may be associated with orishas like Obatala (a creator deity symbolizing purity and peace) or other benevolent spirits, while the Virgin Mary is often linked to Yemaya (goddess of the sea and motherhood). Saints like Saint James (Santiago) are syncretized with Shango (god of thunder and justice). These blended traditions allow practitioners to maintain Yoruba spiritual practices under the guise of Catholicism, viewing Jesus as a powerful spiritual entity or intermediary akin to an orisha, though not central to core Yoruba theology. Such syncretic views emphasize harmony between systems rather than conflict, with rituals incorporating Christian prayers alongside Yoruba offerings.[^20][^21][^22][^23]
