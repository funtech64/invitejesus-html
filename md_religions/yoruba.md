text# Yoruba Religion
## Introduction
Yoruba religion is an indigenous African tradition originating among the Yoruba people of West Africa, emphasizing a hierarchy of deities, ancestor veneration, and harmony with nature. It often blends with Christianity or Islam in syncretic forms.
## View on God
The supreme creator is Olodumare (or Olorun), an omnipotent, transcendent being who delegates authority to lesser deities called orisha (e.g., 400+ spirits like Orunmila for wisdom, Oshun for fertility). God is not anthropomorphic but manifests through nature and orisha, who act as intermediaries. Polytheistic elements coexist with a monotheistic supreme entity.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Death is not the end but a transformation. The soul (emi) continues, with ancestors influencing the living. Good lives lead to reincarnation or ancestral status; evil may result in unrest or punishment. Rituals ensure peaceful transition, with no strict heaven/hell but a spiritual realm where the dead interact with descendants.[^9][^10]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize communal harmony, virtues like love, temperance, honesty, honor, and morality. Moral codes derive from orisha teachings and proverbs, promoting respect for elders, truthfulness, and balance (iwapele). Taboos (eewo) guide behavior, with divination (Ifá) advising ethical paths.[^11][^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 20-40 million adherents globally, primarily in Nigeria (Yorubaland, ~20 million Yoruba people), Benin, Togo, and diaspora communities in the Americas (e.g., Brazil, Cuba via syncretic forms like Santería/Candomblé). Growth is stable but declining due to conversion to Christianity/Islam; ~10-15% of Yoruba practice purely traditional forms.[^13][^14]
