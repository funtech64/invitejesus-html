text# Humanism
## Introduction
Humanism is a philosophical stance, emerging during the Renaissance and formalized in the 20th century, emphasizing human potential, reason, and ethics without reliance on supernatural beliefs. It promotes human dignity and rational inquiry.
## View on God
Humanism is non-theistic, rejecting belief in a personal God or supernatural deities. It focuses on human agency and reason as the basis for understanding the universe, with no divine authority.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are grounded in reason, empathy, and human welfare. Moral codes emphasize compassion, justice, and personal responsibility, with no reliance on divine commandments. Taboos include dogmatism and harm to others.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 100–200 million people globally identify with humanist principles, primarily in Europe, the US, and Canada, often overlapping with secular or non-religious populations. Growth is steady, tied to secularization trends.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Humanism rejects Christian theology, viewing Jesus as a historical figure or moral teacher, not divine. Some humanists admire Jesus’ ethics (e.g., compassion) but prioritize secular ethics over religious doctrine.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Humanism typically denies an afterlife, asserting that consciousness ends at death. The focus is on living a meaningful life, with no heaven, hell, or reincarnation. Some humanists adopt a symbolic view of legacy through deeds or memory, with no spiritual rituals for afterlife preparation.[^9][^10]
