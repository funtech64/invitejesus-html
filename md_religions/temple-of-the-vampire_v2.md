text# Temple of the Vampire
## Introduction
The Temple of the Vampire, founded in 1989 in the US, blends vampirism and esotericism, emphasizing predatory spirituality and immortality.
## View on God
The Temple is non-theistic, viewing divinity as vampiric consciousness. No personal God.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on power and survival. Moral codes include secrecy and spiritual growth. Taboos involve weakness.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000â€“5,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure. Christianity is rejected as limiting.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves vampiric immortality. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^30]

Completed: 200/300 articles (194 unique + 6 new, adjusting for duplicates).
Remaining: ~100 articles from the YAML taxonomy.
Next Steps: Please share the Religion_300_list file to confirm the exact list and identify gaps in the first 140. For now, Iâ€™ll continue with 6 more New Religious Movements from the YAML (e.g., Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis, Thelema, Builders of the Adytum, I AM Movement, Summit Lighthouse) in the next batch. Let me know if you prefer a different category or any tweaks, and Iâ€™ll generate the next set!

This batch covers 6 more New Religious Movements from the YAML: Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis, Thelema, Builders of the Adytum, I AM Movement, and Summit Lighthouse.
