text# Sahaja Yoga
## Introduction
Sahaja Yoga, founded in 1970 by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing self-realization through Kundalini awakening and meditation.
## View on God
Sahaja Yoga is monotheistic, worshiping a divine energy (Adi Shakti) within all. God is impersonal, manifested through spiritual awakening.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and balance. Moral codes include meditation, compassion, and humility. Taboos involve immorality and materialism.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 adherents, primarily in India, Europe, and the US. Growth is modest, tied to meditation communities.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an enlightened figure, embodying divine energy, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; Kundalini meditation prepares the soul for liberation.[^25]
