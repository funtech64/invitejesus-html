text# Sathya Sai Baba Movement
## Introduction
The Sathya Sai Baba Movement, founded in the 1940s by Sathya Sai Baba in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing universal religion, devotion, and service. Sai Baba, considered a divine incarnation, taught unity of faiths through bhakti (devotion) and charity. Centers worldwide offer prayer, meditation, and humanitarian projects like schools and hospitals. The movement attracts followers seeking spiritual unity and practical service, blending Hindu and interfaith elements.
## View on God
The movement is monistic, viewing God as a universal divine presence, manifest in Sai Baba and all religions.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and service. Moral codes include truth, nonviolence, and charity. Taboos involve egoism and division, hindering spiritual unity.
## Demographics
Approximately 6â€“10 million followers, primarily in India and the diaspora. Growth is steady through global centers.[^11]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a divine figure, equal to Sai Baba. Christianity is respected as a path to the same universal truth.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or liberation (*moksha*). No heaven or hell; devotion prepares the soul for divine unity.
