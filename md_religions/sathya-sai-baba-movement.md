text# Sathya Sai Baba Movement
## Introduction
The Sathya Sai Baba Movement, founded in the 1940s by Sathya Sai Baba in India, emphasizes devotion, service, and universal spirituality, rooted in Hindu teachings.
## View on God
The movement is monistic, viewing God as universal consciousness (Brahman). Sathya Sai Baba is an avatar of divinity.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, service, and truth. Moral codes include charity, nonviolence, and devotion. Taboos involve egoism and harm.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million followers, primarily in India, with global centers. Growth is stable but tied to Sai Baba’s legacy.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a divine figure or avatar, equal to Sai Baba. Christianity is respected within a universal spiritual framework.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation (moksha). No heaven/hell; devotion prepares the soul for divine unity.[^25]
