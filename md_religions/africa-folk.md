text# Africa (Traditional Religions)
## Introduction
African Traditional Religions encompass diverse indigenous faiths across Africa, emphasizing ancestors, spirits, and harmony with nature.
## View on God
African Traditional Religions are often monotheistic or polytheistic, with a supreme creator and lesser spirits. Divinity is immanent.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect, rituals, and reciprocity. Taboos involve disrespecting ancestors.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 100–200 million followers, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Growth is tied to Indigenous populations.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a spirit or prophet. Christianity is widely integrated.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^30]
