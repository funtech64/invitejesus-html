# Santería

## Introduction
Santería, also known as La Regla de Ocha or Lucumí, is an Afro-Cuban religion that developed from Yoruba traditions brought by enslaved Africans to Cuba, blended with Roman Catholicism and elements of indigenous spirituality. It emphasizes worship of orishas (deities) through rituals, music, and offerings to achieve harmony and divine favor.

## View on God
Santería is polytheistic with a monotheistic core. The supreme deity is Olodumare (also called Olofi or Olorun), a transcendent creator who is distant and rarely directly involved in human affairs. Olodumare delegates power to orishas, divine intermediaries who embody natural forces and human attributes (e.g., Obatalá for creation and peace, Yemayá for the ocean and motherhood, Shango for thunder and justice). Practitioners view the orishas as accessible manifestations of divine energy, and each person has a guardian orisha determined at initiation.[^1][^2]

## View on Ethics
Ethics in Santería emphasize balance, respect, and reciprocity with the divine and community. Moral codes are derived from orisha teachings and proverbs, promoting virtues like honesty, charity, and harmony (aché). Taboos (eewo) vary by orisha; for example, avoiding certain foods or behaviors to maintain spiritual purity. Divination (e.g., via Ifá or cowrie shells) guides ethical decisions, and rituals like animal sacrifice are seen as necessary for restoring balance and fulfilling obligations to the orishas.[^3][^4]

## Demographics
Approximately 1-3 million adherents globally, primarily in Cuba (where it's practiced by up to 70% of the population in syncretic forms), the United States (especially Florida, New York, and California via Cuban diaspora), Brazil, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico. Growth is steady through cultural preservation and conversions, though often practiced alongside Catholicism; pure Santería adherents are a minority due to syncretism.[^5][^6]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Santería emerged from the forced conversion of enslaved Yoruba people to Catholicism in Cuba, leading to syncretism where orishas were equated with Christian saints to preserve African traditions under colonial oppression. For example, Obatalá is associated with Our Lady of Mercy or Jesus Christ (as a creator figure), Shango with Saint Barbara, and Yemayá with the Virgin Mary. Practitioners often view Jesus as a powerful spiritual entity or orisha-like figure, incorporating Christian prayers, crosses, and saints into rituals. This blending allows dual practice, with Santería seen as complementary to Christianity rather than oppositional, though some orthodox Christians view it as incompatible.[^7][^8][^9]

## View on Afterlife
Santería views death as a transition to the ancestral realm, where the soul (egun) continues to exist and influence the living. There is no strict heaven or hell; instead, the afterlife is a spiritual domain where ancestors reside, offering guidance and protection if honored through rituals. Good lives lead to revered ancestral status and potential reincarnation (atunwa), while unresolved issues may cause unrest, requiring ceremonies to appease spirits. Rituals like itutu (funeral rites) ensure peaceful passage, involving offerings, music, and divination to communicate with the dead. The egun are invoked in ceremonies, blending with Catholic elements like prayers for the deceased.[^10][^11][^12]
