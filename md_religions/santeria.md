text# Santería
## Introduction
Santería, also known as Regla de Ocha, is a syncretic religion originating among Yoruba slaves in Cuba during the 19th century. It blends Yoruba orisha worship with Catholicism, emphasizing rituals, music, and spiritual connection.
## View on God
Santería is polytheistic with a monotheistic undertone, worshiping Olodumare as the supreme creator, distant and transcendent. Orishas (e.g., Oshun, Shango) are divine intermediaries tied to nature and human life, syncretized with Catholic saints.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community, respect for orishas, and spiritual balance. Moral codes emphasize reciprocity, charity, and ritual observance, with divination guiding ethical decisions. Taboos include disrespecting orishas or violating ritual protocols.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million adherents, primarily in Cuba, Brazil, the US (Miami, New York), and Latin America. Growth is steady, driven by diaspora communities, though limited by cultural stigma.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Santería integrates Catholicism, equating Jesus with orishas like Obatala (peace, purity) or as a divine figure. Practitioners often attend Catholic services, blending Christian prayers with orisha worship. Jesus is revered but not central to Santería’s cosmology.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in Orun (spiritual realm) or reincarnating based on deeds. No heaven/hell; rituals like itutu (funerals) and offerings ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral guidance.[^9][^10]
