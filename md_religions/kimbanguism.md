text# Kimbanguism
## Introduction
Kimbanguism is an African Independent Church founded in 1921 by Simon Kimbangu in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rooted in Christianity, it emphasizes African spiritual expression, healing, and resistance to colonial oppression.
## View on God
Kimbanguism is monotheistic, worshiping the Christian God, Jehovah, as the supreme creator. The Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) is central, with Simon Kimbangu revered as a prophet or divine intermediary, sometimes equated with the Holy Spirit.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on Christian principles, emphasizing love, humility, and community welfare. Moral codes include obedience to God, charity, and nonviolence, with a focus on African identity and anti-colonial values. Taboos align with Christian commandments, rejecting immorality and oppression.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million adherents, primarily in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with communities in Angola, Zambia, and diaspora (Europe, US). Growth is steady, driven by its cultural resonance in Central Africa.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Kimbanguism is explicitly Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God and savior whose atonement redeems humanity. Simon Kimbangu is seen as a divinely inspired prophet, not a replacement for Jesus, though some followers elevate his role. The church uses the Bible and Christian rituals, blending them with African practices like healing ceremonies.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Kimbanguism follows Christian eschatology, with souls facing judgment after death. The righteous enter heaven, a realm of eternal communion with God, while the wicked face hell or separation. Kimbangu’s teachings emphasize preparation for heaven through faith and good deeds, with rituals like prayer and healing services reinforcing spiritual readiness. The afterlife is seen as a continuation of God’s kingdom, with Kimbangu as a guide for African believers.[^9][^10]
