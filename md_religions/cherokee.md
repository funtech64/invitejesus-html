## Introduction
Cherokee religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the Cherokee people in the southeastern United States, emphasizing balance, harmony, and connection to nature. It is preserved through oral traditions and ceremonies.
## View on God
Cherokee religion is polytheistic and animistic, with no single supreme God. Key spirits include the Creator (Unelanuhi) and nature spirits, with all life seen as interconnected. The universe is governed by spiritual forces.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony, respect for nature, and community welfare. Moral codes emphasize sharing, humility, and environmental stewardship, with ceremonies like the Green Corn Ceremony reinforcing values. Taboos include disrespecting spirits or sacred sites.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000–400,000 Cherokee people in the US (Oklahoma, North Carolina), with many blending traditional beliefs with Christianity. Traditional adherence is declining due to cultural assimilation.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity was introduced through 19th-century missions, with some Cherokee viewing Jesus as a spiritual figure or healer, similar to traditional spirits. Traditionalists prioritize Cherokee cosmology, with syncretism common in Christian communities.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often called the Darkening Land. No clear heaven/hell; the focus is on earthly balance. Rituals like funeral ceremonies ensure the soul’s peaceful transition, preventing unrest.[^29][^30]
