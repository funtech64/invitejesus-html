text# Lakota
## Introduction
Lakota religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the Lakota Sioux people in the Great Plains of the United States. Centered on Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit), it emphasizes ceremonies like the Sun Dance and Vision Quest for spiritual connection.
## View on God
Lakota religion is polytheistic and animistic, with Wakan Tanka as the encompassing Great Spirit, manifesting through deities like Inyan (rock) and Wi (sun). Spirits inhabit all aspects of nature, guiding human life.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature, community, and spiritual balance. Moral codes emphasize generosity, courage, and respect for all life, with ceremonies reinforcing values. Taboos include disrespecting sacred rituals or the environment.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–150,000 Lakota people in the US (South Dakota, Montana), with many practicing traditional religion alongside Christianity. Adherence is declining due to cultural assimilation.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 19th-century missions, with some Lakota adopting Jesus as a spiritual figure akin to a holy person. Traditionalists prioritize Wakan Tanka, viewing Christianity as secondary. Syncretism exists in some communities.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to the Milky Way or sacred lands. No heaven/hell; the focus is on earthly harmony. Rituals like the Spirit Keeping ceremony ensure the soul’s peaceful journey, preventing unrest.[^19][^20]
