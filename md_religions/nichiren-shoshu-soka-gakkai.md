text# Nichiren Shōshū/Soka Gakkai
## Introduction
Nichiren Shōshū and Soka Gakkai are Japanese Buddhist movements based on the 13th-century teachings of Nichiren, emphasizing chanting the Lotus Sutra (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) for enlightenment. Soka Gakkai, a lay organization, split from Nichiren Shōshū in 1991.
## View on God
Both are non-theistic, as per Buddhism, rejecting a creator God. The Gohonzon (a sacred scroll) represents the eternal Buddha-nature, with Nichiren seen as a Buddha or guide. The divine is immanent in all beings, accessible through chanting.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion, peace, and personal transformation. Moral codes promote respect, nonviolence, and social good, with chanting fostering ethical growth. Taboos include slandering the Lotus Sutra or rejecting Nichiren’s teachings.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Nichiren Shōshū has ~500,000 adherents, primarily in Japan; Soka Gakkai has ~10–12 million globally, with strong presence in Japan, the US, Brazil, and Europe. Soka Gakkai’s growth is robust due to its lay focus.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Both movements have minimal engagement with Christianity, rooted in Buddhist cosmology. Jesus is seen as a historical or ethical figure, not divine, with no role in their theology. Some Soka Gakkai members respect Jesus’ compassion but prioritize Buddhist practice.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with chanting the Lotus Sutra enabling enlightenment (Buddhahood) in this lifetime, reducing rebirth cycles. No heaven/hell; the righteous attain spiritual liberation, while the wicked face lower rebirths. Daily chanting and study prepare the soul.[^29][^30]
