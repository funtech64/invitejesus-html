text# Dinka Religion
## Introduction
Dinka religion is the traditional belief system of the Dinka people of South Sudan, centered on a supreme creator, spirits, and ancestors. It emphasizes rituals, sacrifices, and oral traditions to maintain harmony with the divine and community.
## View on God
Dinka religion is monotheistic with animistic elements. Nhialic is the supreme creator, omnipotent and associated with the sky, governing life and nature. Lesser spirits (jok) and ancestors mediate between Nhialic and humans, inhabiting natural elements.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on communal harmony, respect for elders, and spiritual balance. Moral codes promote honesty, courage, and generosity, with taboos against harming kin or sacred cattle. Divination and sacrifices guide ethical behavior.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 2-3 million Dinka (out of ~4 million Dinka population) practice traditional religion, primarily in South Sudan. Many (~50%) combine it with Christianity due to missionary influence; purely traditional adherents are declining.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 20th-century missions, with some Dinka equating Nhialic with the Christian God. Jesus is viewed as a spiritual figure or prophet but not central; traditionalists prioritize Nhialic and ancestors over Christian theology.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm under Nhialicâ€™s domain. Good lives ensure ancestral status; evil leads to unrest. No heaven/hell; rituals like cattle sacrifices maintain spiritual connections.[^39][^40]
