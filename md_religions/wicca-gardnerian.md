text# Wicca (Gardnerian)
## Introduction
Gardnerian Wicca, founded in the 1950s by Gerald Gardner in the UK, is a neo-pagan religion emphasizing witchcraft, nature, and ritual magic within a coven structure.
## View on God
Gardnerian Wicca is polytheistic, worshiping a Horned God and Triple Goddess (Maiden, Mother, Crone). Divinity is immanent in nature.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on the Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will." Moral codes emphasize freedom, nature reverence, and ritual. Taboos include harm and coercion.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in the UK and US. Growth is limited by its initiatory structure.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often rejected due to historical conflicts with paganism.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or a Summerland realm. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul for spiritual cycles.[^5]
