text# Kemeticism
## Introduction
Kemeticism, revived in the 20th century, is a neo-pagan religion reconstructing ancient Egyptian spirituality, emphasizing balance and divine worship.
## View on God
Kemeticism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Ra and Isis. Divinity is immanent in nature and cosmic order.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on ma’at (order and justice). Moral codes include truth, respect, and ritual. Taboos involve chaos and harm.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is distanced due to historical differences.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a judgment and Field of Reeds (paradise). No hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
