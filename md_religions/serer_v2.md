## Introduction

## View on God
Serer religion is monotheistic, worshiping Roog, with ancestors and spirits as intermediaries.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and purity. Moral codes include respect and rituals. Taboos involve disrespecting ancestors.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million followers, primarily in Senegal and Gambia. Growth is tied to Serer population.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^15]
