text# Mapuche
## Introduction
Mapuche religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the Mapuche people in Chile and Argentina, emphasizing harmony with nature and ancestors. It centers on rituals and oral traditions, resisting cultural assimilation.
## View on God
Mapuche religion is polytheistic and animistic, with Ngenechen as a supreme creator spirit, alongside other deities and nature spirits (ngen). The cosmos is alive with spiritual forces governing life.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature, community, and ancestors. Moral codes emphasize respect, reciprocity, and environmental care, with rituals like the Nguillatun reinforcing values. Taboos include harming sacred lands or spirits.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million Mapuche people in Chile and Argentina, with many practicing traditional religion alongside Catholicism. Traditional adherence is stable but faces modernization pressures.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Catholicism spread through Spanish colonization, with some Mapuche viewing Jesus as a spiritual figure or equivalent to a ngen. Traditionalists prioritize Mapuche cosmology, with syncretism common in Catholic communities.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to the land or sky. No heaven/hell; the focus is on earthly harmony. Rituals like funerals and offerings ensure the soul’s peaceful journey.[^39][^40]
