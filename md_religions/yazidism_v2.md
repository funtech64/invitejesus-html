text# Yazidism
## Introduction
Yazidism is a monotheistic religion practiced by the Yazidi people in Iraq, originating around the 12th century CE. It blends Zoroastrian, Islamic, and Christian elements, centered on the Peacock Angel (Melek Taus).
## View on God
Yazidism is monotheistic, worshiping God (Xwedê) as the supreme creator. Melek Taus, a divine angel, is central, with other angels mediating divine will. No Trinity; God is transcendent.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity, community, and devotion to God. Moral codes emphasize charity, prayer, and respect for Melek Taus. Taboos include blasphemy, intermarriage, and impurity.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 400,000–1 million adherents, primarily in Iraq (Sinjar), with diaspora in Germany and the US. Declining due to persecution (e.g., ISIS genocide).[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Yazidism incorporates Christian elements, viewing Jesus as a prophet or angelic figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but distinct, with Yazidi cosmology focusing on Melek Taus.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or a spiritual realm where the righteous join God and angels. No eternal hell; rituals like baptism and festivals prepare the soul for divine unity.[^49][^50]
