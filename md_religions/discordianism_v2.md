text# Discordianism
## Introduction
Discordianism, founded in 1958 by Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley in the US, is a satirical religion centered on Eris, the goddess of chaos, promoting absurdity and freedom.
## View on God
Discordianism is non-theistic, with Eris as a symbolic chaos figure, not a literal deity. It rejects serious divine concepts.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are playful, emphasizing creativity and questioning authority. Moral codes value humor and individualism. Taboos include rigid dogmatism.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 adherents, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited by its satirical nature.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Discordianism parodies Christianity, viewing Jesus as a humorous figure, not divine. It mocks religious seriousness.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is a non-serious concept, with no defined doctrine. No heaven/hell; chaotic living is the focus, with no rituals.[^25]
