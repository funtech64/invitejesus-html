text# Sathya Sai Baba Movement
## Introduction
The Sathya Sai Baba movement is a spiritual movement founded in the 1940s by Sathya Sai Baba in India. It blends Hinduism, universalism, and service, emphasizing devotion to Sai Baba as a divine avatar.
## View on God
The movement is monotheistic or pantheistic, viewing God as a universal divine principle, with Sathya Sai Baba as an avatar of God, akin to Krishna or Rama. All religions are seen as paths to the same divine truth.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, service, and spiritual growth. Moral codes include the five human values (truth, righteousness, peace, love, nonviolence) and vegetarianism. Taboos include selfishness and harming others.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million adherents, primarily in India, with communities in the US, Europe, and Australia. Growth is steady, centered around Sai Baba’s ashram in Puttaparthi.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The movement views Jesus as a divine avatar, equal to Sai Baba or other spiritual masters. Christianity is respected as a valid path, with Sai Baba’s teachings emphasizing universal love, incorporating Christian ethics.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with the soul cycling until achieving liberation (moksha) through devotion and service. Liberated souls merge with the divine, with no eternal heaven/hell. Devotional practices and charity prepare the soul.[^69][^70]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 75/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults). This completes the Umbrella-Claimant Cults category.
Next Category: I recommend starting Major Religions (6 religions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism) to cover core faiths, which can be done in one batch since it fits within limits. Alternatively, we can revisit smaller categories for deeper detail (e.g., more afterlife focus) or explore a new category like Secular & Philosophical Movements (e.g., Humanism, Atheism).
Batch Size: This batch had 6 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., all 6 for Major Religions).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Major Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Yes pleaseThanks for keeping the enthusiasm high! I'll proceed with the Major Religions category, covering 6 religions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Judaism. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., christianity.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 81/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest starting Secular & Philosophical Movements (7 religions: Humanism, Secular Humanism, Atheism, Agnosticism, Deism, Pantheism, Objectivism) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., more afterlife focus). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
