text# Process Church of the Final Judgment
## Introduction
The Process Church of the Final Judgment, founded in 1966 by Mary Ann MacLean and Robert de Grimston in the UK, is a new religious movement blending Satanism, Christianity, and Gnosticism.
## View on God
The Process Church is dualistic, worshiping a cosmic God with Christ, Jehovah, Lucifer, and Satan as aspects. Divinity is complex and multifaceted.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on reconciliation of opposites. Moral codes include spiritual exploration and unity. Taboos involve imbalance.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 100â€“500 followers at its peak; nearly extinct today. Growth stopped due to controversies.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is one of four divine aspects. Christianity is reinterpreted through Gnostic and Satanic lenses.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a final judgment and spiritual reconciliation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
