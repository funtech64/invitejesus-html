## Introduction
Andean religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of Andean peoples in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, centered on deities like Inti (sun) and Pachamama (earth). It emphasizes reciprocity and harmony with nature.
## View on God
Andean religion is polytheistic and animistic, with Inti and Pachamama as central deities, alongside spirits (huacas) in mountains and rivers. No single supreme God; the cosmos is interconnected with spiritual forces.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on ayni (reciprocity), respect for nature, and community. Moral codes emphasize sharing, environmental care, and ritual offerings. Taboos include disrupting natural balance or neglecting ancestors.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 3–5 million Andean people practice traditional beliefs, primarily in Peru and Bolivia, often alongside Catholicism. Adherence is declining due to urbanization and Christian influence.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Catholicism spread through Spanish colonization, with some Andeans blending Jesus with Inti or other deities. Traditionalists prioritize Andean spirits, with syncretism common in Catholic practices.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to sacred mountains. No heaven/hell; rituals like offerings and festivals ensure the soul’s harmony with the cosmos.[^49][^50]
