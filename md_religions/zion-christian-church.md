text# Zion Christian Church
## Introduction
The Zion Christian Church (ZCC) is a South African African Independent Church founded in 1910 by Engenas Lekganyane. It blends Christian theology with African traditions, emphasizing healing, prophecy, and large-scale pilgrimages to Moria, South Africa.
## View on God
The ZCC is monotheistic, worshiping the Christian God as the supreme creator within the Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). God is accessible through prayer, prophecy, and rituals like holy water and dance.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics align with Christian values, promoting love, humility, and community unity. Moral codes emphasize obedience to God, charity, and respect for leaders like Lekganyane. Taboos include sin and neglecting spiritual practices.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 5â€“7 million adherents, primarily in South Africa (Limpopo, Gauteng), with communities in Zimbabwe, Botswana, and diaspora (UK, US). Growth is robust due to its appeal among urban and rural Africans.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The ZCC is explicitly Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God and savior. Lekganyane is revered as a prophet, not divine, with Jesus central to salvation. Rituals blend African practices (e.g., drumming) with Christian worship.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Christian eschatology, with souls judged after death. The righteous enter heaven, an eternal paradise with God, while the wicked face hell. ZCC rituals like pilgrimages and healing services prepare believers for heaven, with prophecies guiding spiritual life.[^29][^30]
