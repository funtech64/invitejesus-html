text# Baltic Neopaganism (Dievturība, Romuva)
## Introduction
Baltic Neopaganism, including Dievturība (Latvia) and Romuva (Lithuania), is a modern revival of pre-Christian Baltic paganism, emerging in the 20th century. It honors Baltic gods and emphasizes nature, folklore, and cultural heritage.
## View on God
Baltic Neopaganism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Dievs (sky god), Laima (fate), and Saule (sun). Some see Dievs as a supreme force, but the divine is immanent in nature, with spirits in forests and rivers.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature and community. Moral codes promote respect, hospitality, and environmental stewardship, with rituals like solstice celebrations reinforcing values. Taboos include harming sacred sites.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 adherents, primarily in Latvia and Lithuania, with small groups in the US and Europe. Growth is slow, tied to cultural revival.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Baltic Neopaganism rejects Christianity, which suppressed Baltic paganism. Jesus is seen as a historical figure, with no role in Baltic theology. Some respect his ethics but prioritize native gods.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm (Dausos) or reincarnation, with souls joining ancestors or cycling based on deeds. No heaven/hell; rituals like Vėlinės honor the dead and ensure spiritual peace.[^69][^70]
