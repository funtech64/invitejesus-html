text# Integral Yoga (Sri Aurobindo)
## Introduction
Integral Yoga, founded in the early 20th century by Sri Aurobindo in India, emphasizes spiritual evolution and divine consciousness through yoga and meditation.
## View on God
Integral Yoga is monistic, viewing God as supreme consciousness (Brahman). Divinity is in all beings.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual transformation. Moral codes include compassion, self-discipline, and service. Taboos involve egoism.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is limited.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual avatar, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected as a path to divine consciousness.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; yoga prepares the soul for divine unity.[^20]
