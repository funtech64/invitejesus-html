text# Thelema
## Introduction
Thelema is an esoteric religion founded in 1904 by Aleister Crowley in England, based on the Book of the Law. It emphasizes individual will, magic, and spiritual liberation, blending Western occultism, Eastern mysticism, and ceremonial practices.
## View on God
Thelema is pantheistic or polytheistic, with a focus on the divine as an inner force accessible through the True Will. Deities like Nuit (infinite space), Hadit (individual consciousness), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (solar force) are symbolic, not literal gods. Practitioners may also invoke other pantheons.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," meaning following one’s True Will in harmony with the universe. Moral codes emphasize self-discovery, responsibility, and respect for others’ wills. Taboos include suppressing one’s will or harming others’ autonomy.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 adherents globally, primarily in the US, UK, and Europe, often within occult communities. Growth is limited due to its esoteric nature and controversial founder.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Thelema rejects traditional Christianity as restrictive, though Crowley referenced Christian symbolism (e.g., the Beast in Revelation). Jesus is viewed as a historical figure or archetype of enlightenment, not divine. Some Thelemites incorporate Christian mysticism, but most focus on Thelemic cosmology.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
Thelema’s afterlife beliefs vary, often involving reincarnation or spiritual continuity. The soul, as an expression of Hadit, cycles through lives to fulfill its True Will, with no fixed heaven/hell. Some believe in a post-death astral plane for reflection. Rituals like the Gnostic Mass prepare the soul for ongoing evolution.[^19][^20]
