text# Ifá
## Introduction
Ifá, a divination system within Yoruba religion, originating in Nigeria, focuses on wisdom from Orunmila for spiritual guidance.
## View on God
Ifá is polytheistic, venerating Olodumare as supreme, with Orunmila as the wisdom deity.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on destiny and harmony. Moral codes include divination, respect, and community. Taboos involve ignoring guidance.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million practitioners, primarily in West Africa and diaspora. Growth is tied to Yoruba.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a prophet. Christianity is blended in some practices.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; divination prepares the soul.[^10]
