text# Independent Catholic
## Introduction
Independent Catholic Churches, emerging in the 19th–20th centuries, are Christian groups operating outside Roman Catholicism, emphasizing autonomy.
## View on God
Independent Catholicism is monotheistic, worshiping one God in Trinity.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and inclusivity. Moral codes include charity and sacraments. Taboos involve exclusion.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is modest.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is divine, part of the Trinity. Christianity is central, with diverse practices.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves heaven or hell, often with purgatory. Sacraments prepare the soul.[^20]
