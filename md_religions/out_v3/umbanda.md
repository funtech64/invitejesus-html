# Umbanda
## Introduction
Umbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion that blends African traditions (especially Yoruba and Bantu), Spiritism, Catholicism, and indigenous elements. Founded in the early 20th century, it focuses on spirit mediumship, healing, and charity through rituals involving music and possession.
## View on God
Umbanda is monotheistic with polytheistic elements. The supreme deity is Olorum or Zambi (equivalent to the Christian God), a transcendent creator. Authority is delegated to orixás (deities like Iemanjá for seas, Oxalá for peace) and spirits (e.g., caboclos as indigenous guides, pretos-velhos as wise elders). These entities act as intermediaries for divine will.[^23][^24]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on charity, moral evolution, and karma. Practitioners emphasize helping others, humility, and spiritual growth to advance through reincarnation. Moral codes include avoiding harm, respecting nature, and following spirit guidance, with rituals reinforcing virtues like compassion and justice.[^25][^26]
## Demographics
Approximately 0.5-1 million adherents, primarily in Brazil (especially Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), with small communities in Argentina, Uruguay, and the US. Growth is modest; many practice alongside Catholicism or Spiritism.[^27][^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Umbanda incorporates Christian elements, viewing Jesus as a high spirit or master (often syncretized with Oxalá). Rituals include Christian prayers, crosses, and saints equated with orixás. It blends with Catholicism, allowing dual practice, though some Christians see it as incompatible due to spiritism.[^29][^30]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation based on karma, with souls evolving through multiple lives toward spiritual perfection. Death leads to a spiritual plane where spirits guide the living; good deeds lead to higher realms, evil to lower ones requiring purification. No eternal hell; focus on progress and charity.[^31][^32]
