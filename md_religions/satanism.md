text# Satanism
## Introduction
Satanism encompasses various modern movements, primarily LaVeyan Satanism (founded 1966 by Anton LaVey) and Theistic Satanism. It ranges from atheistic philosophy to spiritual worship of Satan, often rejecting mainstream religious norms.
## View on God
LaVeyan Satanism is atheistic, viewing Satan as a symbol of individualism, not a deity. Theistic Satanism worships Satan as a spiritual entity, often opposing the Christian God. No unified theology exists; the divine is either symbolic or a rebellious force.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
LaVeyan ethics emphasize individualism, self-interest, and hedonism, guided by the Eleven Satanic Rules (e.g., do not harm unless provoked). Theistic Satanism varies, often valuing freedom and defiance. Taboos include conformity and unnecessary cruelty.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 adherents globally, primarily in the US, Europe, and online communities. LaVeyan Satanism (via Church of Satan) and The Satanic Temple dominate; growth is modest due to controversy.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Satanism defines itself in opposition to Christianity. LaVeyans view Jesus as a mythological figure, irrelevant to their philosophy. Theistic Satanists may see Jesus as an antagonist or irrelevant, focusing on Satan. The Satanic Temple uses Christian imagery satirically.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
LaVeyan Satanism denies an afterlife, focusing on earthly existence; death is final. Theistic Satanism varies, with some believing in a spiritual realm with Satan or reincarnation. No universal heaven/hell; rituals focus on empowerment, not afterlife preparation.[^39][^40]
