text# Candomblé
## Introduction
Candomblé, developed in Brazil from Yoruba traditions, is a syncretic faith blending Orisha worship with Catholicism.
## View on God
Candomblé is polytheistic, worshiping Olorun as supreme, with Orixás like Oxalá as intermediaries.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect and rituals. Taboos involve disrespecting Orixás.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 2–5 million followers, primarily in Brazil. Growth is steady.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a divine figure. Christianity is integrated.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
