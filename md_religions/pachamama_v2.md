text# Pachamama
## Introduction
Pachamama devotion is the traditional Andean religion venerating Pachamama, the earth mother, as the provider of fertility and sustenance. Practiced by Quechua and Aymara in Peru and Bolivia, it involves offerings (pagos) of coca leaves and alcohol at sacred sites. Festivals like August's Pachamama Month celebrate harvests. Despite colonial suppression, it persists, blending with Catholicism in rituals.
## View on God
Pachamama devotion is polytheistic, centering Pachamama alongside Inti (sun) and Viracocha (creator). Divinity is immanent in the earth.
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize reciprocity and harmony. Moral codes include offerings, community solidarity, and environmental stewardship. Taboos involve exploiting the earth.
## Demographics
Approximately 2â€“3 million followers, primarily in Peru and Bolivia. Growth is tied to Indigenous communities.[^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized with Inti or Viracocha. Christianity is integrated, with Pachamama venerated alongside Mary.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves returning to spiritual realms or ancestors. No heaven or hell; offerings ensure harmony for the soul.
