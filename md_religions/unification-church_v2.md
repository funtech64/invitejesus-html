text# Unification Church
## Introduction
The Unification Church, founded in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon in South Korea, is a new religious movement emphasizing divine unity and the *Divine Principle*.
## View on God
The Unification Church is monotheistic, worshiping God as a personal creator with masculine and feminine aspects. Jesus is a key figure but not fully divine.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on family, love, and world peace. Moral codes include chastity, charity, and devotion. Taboos involve infidelity and division.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million adherents, primarily in South Korea, Japan, and the US. Growth is declining due to controversies.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a central figure, seen as a failed messiah completed by Moon. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm where souls progress toward divine unity. No eternal hell; blessings and prayers prepare the soul.[^15]
