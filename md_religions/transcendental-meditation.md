text# Transcendental Meditation
## Introduction
Transcendental Meditation (TM), founded in 1955 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing mantra-based meditation for inner peace and enlightenment.
## View on God
TM is non-theistic, focusing on universal consciousness rather than a personal God. Divinity is internal, accessed through meditation.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal growth and harmony. Moral codes include meditation, compassion, and nonviolence. Taboos involve stress and materialism.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–6 million practitioners, primarily in the US, Europe, and India. Growth is steady, tied to wellness trends.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a sage or enlightened figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to TM’s universal spirituality.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or spiritual evolution. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for enlightenment.[^15]
