text# Temple of the Vampire
## Introduction
The Temple of the Vampire, founded in 1989 in the US, is a new religious movement blending vampirism with esotericism, emphasizing predatory spirituality and immortality.
## View on God
The Temple is non-theistic, viewing divinity as vampiric consciousness. No personal God; focus is on eternal life.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal power and survival. Moral codes include secrecy and spiritual development. Taboos involve weakness and betrayal.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its esoteric nature.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is rejected as limiting.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves vampiric immortality or spiritual continuation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^30]

## View on God
Universal Medicine is pantheistic, viewing God as a universal energy or love force. No personal deity is central; divinity is within all beings.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal integrity and love. Moral codes include healthy living, compassion, and spiritual awareness. Taboos involve disharmony and negativity.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 2,000–5,000 followers, primarily in Australia, the UK, and the US. Growth is limited by controversies.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to Universal Medicine's teachings.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; healing practices prepare the soul for harmony.[^5]
