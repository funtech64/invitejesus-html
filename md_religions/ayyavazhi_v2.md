text# Ayyavazhi
## Introduction
Ayyavazhi is a henotheistic religion originating in 19th-century South India, founded by Ayya Vaikundar. It blends Hindu and local traditions, emphasizing social reform and devotion, based on the *Akilathirattu Ammanai*.
## View on God
Ayyavazhi is henotheistic, worshiping Narayana (Vishnu) as the supreme God, with Vaikundar as his incarnation. Other deities are secondary, with God seen as both transcendent and immanent.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on dharma, equality, and social reform. Moral codes emphasize nonviolence, charity, and devotion to Vaikundar. Taboos include casteism and harming others.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million adherents, primarily in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, India. Growth is limited due to its regional focus.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Ayyavazhi respects Jesus as a spiritual figure or teacher, but not divine, with Vaikundar as the central incarnation. Christianity is seen as a parallel tradition, with minimal direct engagement.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with the righteous achieving moksha (liberation) or joining Vaikundar in paradise. No eternal hell; rituals like thuvayal thavasu (purification) prepare the soul.[^59][^60]
