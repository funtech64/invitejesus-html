text# God Light Association (GLA)
## Introduction
God Light Association (GLA), founded in 1969 by Shinji Takahashi in Japan, is a spiritual movement blending Buddhism and New Age ideas, emphasizing divine light.
## View on God
GLA is monotheistic, worshiping a universal God of light. Takahashi is seen as a spiritual guide.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and spiritual growth. Moral codes include compassion, meditation, and service. Taboos involve negativity and harm.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–50,000 followers, primarily in Japan. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to GLA’s teachings.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for divine unity.[^20]
