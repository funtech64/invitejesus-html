text# Church of All Worlds
## Introduction
The Church of All Worlds (CAW) is a neopagan religion founded in 1962 by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in the United States, inspired by Robert A. Heinlein’s novel *Stranger in a Strange Land*. It emphasizes pantheism, nature worship, and communal spirituality.
## View on God
CAW is pantheistic, viewing the Earth (Gaea) as a living, divine organism, with all beings interconnected. No personal God exists; the divine is the totality of nature and consciousness.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on ecological harmony, love, and personal growth. Moral codes promote environmental stewardship, polyamory, and community, with the phrase "Thou art God/dess" encouraging self-divinity. Taboos include harming nature or others’ autonomy.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 adherents, primarily in the US (California, Oregon). Growth is limited due to its small, communal focus.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
CAW rejects traditional Christianity, favoring pagan spirituality. Jesus is seen as a historical or mythical figure, possibly a teacher, but not divine. No significant engagement with Christian theology exists.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
CAW’s afterlife beliefs vary, often involving reincarnation or merging with Gaea’s consciousness. No heaven/hell; souls may cycle through lives or join a collective spiritual energy. Rituals like festivals celebrate life’s continuity.[^59][^60]
