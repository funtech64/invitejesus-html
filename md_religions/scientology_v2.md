## Introduction
Scientology is a new religious movement founded in 1952 by L. Ron Hubbard in the US, emphasizing spiritual self-discovery through auditing and the *Dianetics* system.
## View on God
Scientology is non-theistic, with a vague concept of a Supreme Being. The focus is on the thetan (soul), not a personal God.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal growth and survival. Moral codes emphasize rationality and auditing to clear negative experiences. Taboos include suppressing spiritual progress.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and Australia. Growth is limited by controversy.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Scientology has minimal Christian engagement. Jesus is seen as a historical figure, not divine, with no central role.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the thetan reincarnating or achieving spiritual freedom. No heaven/hell; auditing prepares the soul.[^15]
