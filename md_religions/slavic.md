## Introduction
Slavic religion, practiced by Slavic peoples in Eastern Europe (circa 500–1000 CE), was a polytheistic tradition centered on deities like Perun and Veles. It emphasizes nature and is preserved in folklore and rituals.
## View on God
Slavic religion was polytheistic, with gods like Perun (thunder), Veles (underworld), and Mokosh (earth). No single supreme deity; spirits (e.g., domovoi) inhabited homes and nature.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on community, respect for gods, and harmony with nature. Moral codes emphasized loyalty, hospitality, and ritual observance. Taboos included disrespecting spirits or violating sacred customs.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
No widespread adherents today; extinct by the 12th century CE. Historically practiced by millions in Eastern Europe. Modern Rodnovery revivals number ~10,000–20,000 globally.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Slavic religion was replaced by Christianity, with some deities syncretized with saints (e.g., Perun with St. Elijah). Jesus had no role in Slavic theology, but Christian missionaries adapted Slavic rituals.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved Nav (underworld) or Iriy (paradise), where souls joined ancestors or gods. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured peaceful transitions.[^39][^40]
