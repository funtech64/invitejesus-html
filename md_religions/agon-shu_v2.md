text# Agon Shu
## Introduction
Agon Shu, founded in 1978 by Seiyu Kiriyama in Japan, is a Buddhist-derived new religious movement emphasizing the Agama sutras and esoteric rituals for enlightenment.
## View on God
Agon Shu is non-theistic, focusing on Buddha-nature. Spiritual forces guide practitioners.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion and discipline. Moral codes include meditation and service. Taboos involve harm.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000â€“500,000 followers, primarily in Japan. Growth is limited.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a moral teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until Nirvana. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^15]
