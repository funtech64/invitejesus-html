text# San
## Introduction
San (Bushman) religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the San people in southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa), centered on animism, shamanism, and connection to nature. It emphasizes oral traditions and trance dances.
## View on God
San religion is polytheistic and animistic, with deities like Kaggen (trickster/creator) and spirits in animals and nature. No single supreme God; the divine is immanent in the environment and ancestors.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature, community sharing, and respect for spirits. Moral codes emphasize cooperation and humility, with trance dances reinforcing values. Taboos include harming sacred animals or the environment.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000 San people, with many practicing traditional beliefs alongside Christianity. Adherence is declining due to displacement and modernization.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through colonial missions, with some San equating Jesus with a spirit or healer. Traditionalists prioritize San spirits, viewing Jesus as a foreign figure. Syncretism is limited but present.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors or spirits in a spiritual realm, often tied to the sky or land. No heaven/hell; trance dances and rituals ensure peaceful transitions and spiritual guidance.[^39][^40]
