text# Divine Light Mission
## Introduction
Divine Light Mission, founded in 1960 by Hans Ji Maharaj in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing meditation and divine knowledge, now led by Prem Rawat.
## View on God
The Mission is monistic, viewing God as an inner divine light, not a personal deity. The focus is on spiritual experience.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on peace and self-realization. Moral codes include meditation, compassion, and truth. Taboos involve materialism and egoism.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 followers, primarily in India, the US, and Europe. Growth is limited post-1980s.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to the Mission’s teachings.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for divine unity.[^5]
