text# Bahá’í
## Introduction
The Bahá’í Faith is a monotheistic religion founded in 19th-century Persia by Bahá’u’lláh. It emphasizes unity of God, religion, and humanity, based on Bahá’í scriptures like the *Kitáb-i-Aqdas*.
## View on God
Bahá’í is strictly monotheistic, worshiping one God, transcendent and unknowable. Prophets (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh, Muhammad, Jesus) are Manifestations of God, revealing divine will.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on unity, justice, and spiritual growth. Moral codes include prayer, equality, and service to humanity. Taboos include prejudice, backbiting, and harming others.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–8 million adherents, primarily in Iran, India, Africa, and the US. Growth is steady, driven by global outreach, though limited by persecution in some regions.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Bahá’í recognizes Jesus as a Manifestation of God, equal to other prophets like Muhammad and Bahá’u’lláh, but not uniquely divine. Christianity is seen as a valid divine religion, fulfilled by Bahá’í teachings.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul’s spiritual journey toward God, with paradise as closeness to divine truth and hell as distance. No physical heaven/hell; practices like prayer and good deeds prepare the soul.[^19][^20]
