text# Alawites
## Introduction
Alawites, also known as Alawis or Nusayris, are a syncretic Islamic sect originating in the 9th century in the Middle East, founded by Ibn Nusayr. Rooted in Shia Islam, it incorporates Gnostic and Christian elements, primarily practiced in Syria.
## View on God
Alawites are monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the supreme creator, as in mainstream Islam. They emphasize an esoteric trinity (Ain-Mim-Sin) representing Ali, Muhammad, and Salman, seen as divine manifestations. Allah is transcendent, accessible through mystical knowledge.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics align with Islamic principles, emphasizing piety, secrecy, and community loyalty. Moral codes include charity, truthfulness, and adherence to esoteric teachings. Taboos include revealing secret doctrines to outsiders and immorality.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–3 million adherents, primarily in Syria (10–15% of the population), with smaller communities in Lebanon, Turkey, and diaspora (Europe, US). Stable but faces persecution in Sunni-majority regions.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Alawites incorporate Christian elements, viewing Jesus as a prophet and spiritual figure, not divine, similar to Islamic theology. Some Alawite traditions revere Christian saints and festivals, blending them with Islamic and Gnostic beliefs, though mainstream Christianity is seen as distinct.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation, a unique Alawite belief, with souls cycling through lives based on deeds to achieve spiritual purity. Righteous souls may ascend to a divine realm, while the wicked face lower rebirths. No eternal hell; esoteric rituals and study prepare the soul for liberation.[^19][^20]
