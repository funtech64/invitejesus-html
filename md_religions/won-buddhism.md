text# Won Buddhism
## Introduction
Won Buddhism is a modern Korean religion founded in 1916 by Sot’aesan (Pak Chung-bin), reforming traditional Buddhism to emphasize practical spirituality and social engagement. It centers on the Il-Won-Sang (One Circle) as a symbol of truth.
## View on God
Won Buddhism is non-theistic, rejecting a personal God. The Il-Won-Sang represents Dharmakaya, the ultimate truth or Buddha-nature, present in all beings. No deities are worshipped; the focus is on universal truth.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on gratitude, mindfulness, and social harmony. Moral codes include the Fourfold Grace (heaven, parents, brethren, laws) and nonviolence. Taboos include selfishness and harming others.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million adherents, primarily in South Korea, with communities in the US and Europe. Growth is modest, competing with Christianity and secularism.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Won Buddhism respects Jesus as a moral teacher or enlightened figure, akin to the Buddha, but not divine. Some Korean Won Buddhists engage in Christian dialogue, but the religion remains Buddhist in focus.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with the goal of enlightenment through Won Buddhist practice. No heaven/hell; the soul cycles until achieving liberation. Meditation and ethical living prepare the soul.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 113/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions + 5 East Asian Traditional Religions). This completes the East Asian Traditional Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Afro-Caribbean Religions (5 religions: Santería, Vodou, Candomblé, Umbanda, Quimbanda) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Ancient Mediterranean Religions like Greek, Roman) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Afro-Caribbean Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!pleaseThanks for keeping the momentum going! I'll proceed with the Afro-Caribbean Religions category, covering 5 religions: Santería, Vodou, Candomblé, Umbanda, and Quimbanda. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., santeria.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 118/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Ancient Mediterranean Religions (e.g., Greek, Roman, Mithraism) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
