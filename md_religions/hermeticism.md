text# Hermeticism
## Introduction
Hermeticism is a philosophical and esoteric tradition rooted in the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, emerging in Hellenistic Egypt (2nd–3rd century CE) and revived in the Renaissance and modern era. It emphasizes mystical knowledge, alchemy, and spiritual transformation.
## View on God
Hermeticism is monistic or pantheistic, viewing God as the All, an infinite, immanent consciousness encompassing the universe. The divine is accessible through gnosis (spiritual knowledge), with no anthropomorphic deity but a cosmic unity often called the Monad or Nous.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-knowledge, spiritual growth, and harmony with the cosmos. Moral codes emphasize truth, wisdom, and compassion, with practices like meditation and alchemy fostering enlightenment. Taboos include ignorance and materialism that obstruct divine understanding.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–50,000 modern adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and online communities, often within esoteric or New Age circles. Growth is modest due to its intellectual and niche appeal.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Hermeticism influenced early Christianity (e.g., via Neoplatonism) but diverges in its non-theistic focus. Modern Hermeticists may view Jesus as a sage or enlightened figure who achieved gnosis, similar to Hermes, but he is not central. Some blend Hermetic ideas with Christian mysticism, though most prioritize esoteric knowledge over Christian theology.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Hermeticism posits that the soul, a spark of the divine, undergoes cycles of reincarnation to achieve gnosis and reunite with the All. After death, the soul may ascend through cosmic planes (e.g., planetary spheres) or reincarnate based on spiritual progress. No heaven/hell; rituals like meditation prepare the soul for liberation from material bonds.[^9][^10]
