text# Celtic Reconstructionism
## Introduction
Celtic Reconstructionism is a modern pagan revival of pre-Christian Celtic religions, emerging in the late 20th century. It seeks to reconstruct Irish, Scottish, and Welsh spiritual practices, emphasizing historical accuracy and nature worship.
## View on God
Celtic Reconstructionism is polytheistic, honoring Celtic gods like Lugh, Morrígan, and Danu. Spirits of the land and ancestors are also revered. The divine is immanent, with no single supreme deity.[^71][^72]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize honor, community, and respect for nature. Moral codes promote hospitality, courage, and truth, with rituals like offerings reinforcing values. Taboos include disrespecting sacred sites or ancestors.[^73][^74]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–15,000 adherents, primarily in Ireland, Scotland, the US, and Canada. Growth is slow due to its focus on historical accuracy.[^75][^76]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Celtic Reconstructionism rejects Christianity, which displaced Celtic paganism. Jesus is seen as a historical or mythical figure, with no role in Celtic theology. Some respect his ethics but prioritize Celtic deities.[^77][^78]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the Otherworld, a spiritual realm of peace and wisdom, or reincarnation based on deeds. No heaven/hell; souls join ancestors or cycle, with rituals like Samhain ensuring spiritual harmony.[^79][^80]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 41/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements). This completes the Pagan & Revivalist Movements category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Syncretic & Ayahuasca (2 religions: Santo Daime, União do Vegetal) for a quick batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, I can do Esoteric & Occult (6 religions) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 8 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., 2 for Syncretic & Ayahuasca).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!YesAwesome, thanks for the confirmation! I'll proceed with the Syncretic & Ayahuasca category, covering 2 religions: Santo Daime and União do Vegetal. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., santo-daime.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 43/140 articles toward your goal. Since it’s a small category, I’ll include both files below. After this, I suggest moving to Esoteric & Occult (6 religions: Hermeticism, Thelema, Chaos Magick, Satanism, Luciferianism, Gnosticism) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category (e.g., New Religious Movements). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
