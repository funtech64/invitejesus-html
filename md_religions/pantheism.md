text# Pantheism
## Introduction
Pantheism is a philosophical belief, with roots in ancient thought and formalized in the modern era, equating God with the universe and nature. It emphasizes the divine in all things, often embraced by scientists and philosophers.
## View on God
Pantheism is monistic, viewing God as identical to the universe, not a personal deity. All existence (nature, matter, energy) is divine, with no separation between creator and creation.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are grounded in reverence for nature and interconnectedness. Moral codes promote environmental stewardship, compassion, and reason, with taboos against harming the natural world or others.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 20–50 million people globally align with pantheistic views, primarily in the US, Europe, and Asia, often within secular or New Age circles. Numbers are estimates due to its non-organized nature.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Pantheism rejects Christian theology, viewing Jesus as a historical figure or symbol of human potential, not divine. Some pantheists admire Jesus’ ethical teachings but see Christianity as anthropocentric.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
Pantheism typically denies a personal afterlife, viewing death as a return to the universal divine. Some see consciousness dissolving into nature; others are agnostic. No rituals address the afterlife, with focus on earthly harmony.[^59][^60]
