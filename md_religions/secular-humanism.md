text# Secular Humanism
## Introduction
Secular Humanism is a 20th-century offshoot of humanism, emphasizing a non-religious worldview based on reason, science, and human ethics. It rejects supernatural beliefs and promotes human flourishing through secular means.
## View on God
Secular Humanism is explicitly atheistic or agnostic, denying the existence of God or deities. It views the universe as governed by natural laws, with no divine intervention.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on human reason, empathy, and social good. Moral codes promote fairness, compassion, and human rights, with no divine basis. Taboos include superstition and harm to human welfare.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 50–100 million people globally align with secular humanism, primarily in the US, Europe, and Australia, often within broader secular or humanist communities. Growth is tied to global secularization.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Secular Humanism rejects Christianity as a supernatural belief system. Jesus is seen as a historical figure or moral exemplar, not divine. Some secular humanists value Jesus’ teachings on compassion but reject Christian theology.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
Secular Humanism denies an afterlife, asserting that life ends at death. The focus is on creating meaning in this life through ethics and community. No heaven, hell, or reincarnation; legacy is through human impact, with no spiritual rituals.[^19][^20]
