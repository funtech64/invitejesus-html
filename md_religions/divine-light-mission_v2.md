text# Divine Light Mission
## Introduction
Divine Light Mission, founded in 1960 by Hans Ji Maharaj in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing meditation and divine knowledge, now led by Prem Rawat.
## View on God
The Mission is monistic, viewing God as an inner divine light. The focus is on spiritual experience.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on peace and self-realization. Moral codes include compassion and truth. Taboos involve materialism.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is modest.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^5]
