text# Taoism
## Introduction
Taoism (Daoism) is an ancient Chinese spiritual tradition, originating around the 4th century BCE with texts like the *Tao Te Ching* by Laozi. It emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the Way), a cosmic principle of balance and flow.
## View on God
Taoism is non-theistic or pantheistic, with the Tao as an impersonal, universal force, not a deity. Deities like the Jade Emperor or the Three Pure Ones are revered in religious Taoism but are secondary to the Tao’s natural order.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on wu-wei (non-action), simplicity, and harmony with nature. Moral codes emphasize compassion, humility, and moderation, with practices like meditation fostering balance. Taboos include forcing outcomes or disrupting the Tao’s flow.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 10–20 million adherents practice religious Taoism, primarily in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, with millions more following Taoist philosophy. Growth is stable but faces competition from secularism.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Taoism has minimal engagement with Christianity. Jesus is seen as a sage or moral teacher by some, but not divine, with no role in Taoist cosmology. Some Taoist-Christian syncretism exists in diaspora communities.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife varies: philosophical Taoism often denies a personal afterlife, emphasizing merging with the Tao. Religious Taoism believes in immortality through spiritual cultivation or a soul residing in celestial realms. No heaven/hell; rituals like meditation and alchemy prepare the soul for transcendence.[^9][^10]
