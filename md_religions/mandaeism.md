text# Mandaeism
## Introduction
Mandaeism is an ancient Gnostic religion originating in the 1st–2nd century CE in the Mesopotamia region (modern Iraq/Iran). It emphasizes baptism, esoteric knowledge, and a dualistic worldview, with a small but resilient community preserving its traditions.
## View on God
Mandaeism is monotheistic, centered on the Great Life (Hayyi Rabbi), the supreme creator who emanates light and knowledge. Lesser beings, like angels (uthras), assist in creation and spiritual guidance. A dualistic cosmology pits the World of Light against the World of Darkness, with evil forces led by demons.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity, truth, and adherence to ritual practices like baptism (masbuta). Moral codes emphasize nonviolence, charity, and community cohesion. Taboos include harming water sources (sacred to Mandaeans) and deviating from ritual purity.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 60,000–100,000 adherents globally, primarily in Iraq, Iran, and diaspora communities (Australia, US, Sweden). Declining due to persecution and emigration, especially post-2003 Iraq War.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Mandaeans view John the Baptist as a central prophet, but Jesus is controversial. Some Mandaean texts portray Jesus as a false messiah or misguided figure who deviated from John’s teachings, while others ignore him. Christianity is seen as a rival tradition, with Mandaeans rejecting its theology but sharing historical roots in the region’s Jewish and Christian milieu.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul’s ascent to the World of Light, a realm of purity and divine presence, after purification through rituals. At death, the soul faces judgment, with righteous souls guided by uthras to eternal light, while the wicked are trapped in darkness or undergo purification in a purgatory-like state. Repeated baptisms during life ensure spiritual readiness, with the soul’s journey depicted in texts like the Ginza Rba. The ultimate goal is union with the Great Life, free from material corruption.[^19][^20]
