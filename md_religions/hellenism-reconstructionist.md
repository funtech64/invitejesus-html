text# Hellenism (Reconstructionist)
## Introduction
Hellenism, revived in the 20th century, is a neo-pagan religion reconstructing ancient Greek spirituality, emphasizing worship of Olympian gods.
## View on God
Hellenism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Zeus and Athena. Divinity is immanent in nature and human affairs.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on piety and community. Moral codes include hospitality, ritual, and justice. Taboos involve hubris and disrespect.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 followers, primarily in Greece and the US. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often distanced due to historical conflicts.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes Hades or Elysium. No heaven/hell; rituals ensure spiritual continuity.[^25]
