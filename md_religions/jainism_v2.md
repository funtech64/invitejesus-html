text# Jainism
## Introduction
Jainism is an ancient Indian religion, originating around the 6th century BCE, founded by Mahavira. It emphasizes nonviolence (ahimsa), asceticism, and liberation of the soul, based on texts like the *Agamas*.
## View on God
Jainism is non-theistic, rejecting a creator God. The universe is eternal, governed by natural laws. Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers like Mahavira) are revered as enlightened beings, not deities.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on ahimsa, truth, and asceticism. Moral codes include nonviolence, vegetarianism, honesty, and non-attachment. Taboos include harming any living being or indulging in materialism.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 4–6 million adherents, primarily in India, with diaspora communities in the US, UK, and Canada. Growth is stable but limited by its ascetic focus.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jainism has minimal engagement with Christianity. Jesus is seen as a moral teacher or potential Tirthankara-like figure, but not divine. Jainism’s non-theistic worldview is distinct from Christian theology.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with souls cycling through lives until achieving moksha (liberation), a state of eternal bliss free from samsara. No heaven/hell; ascetic practices like meditation and fasting prepare the soul.[^9][^10]
