text# Transcendental Meditation
## Introduction
Transcendental Meditation (TM), founded in the 1950s by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India, is a spiritual movement promoting a meditation technique for stress relief and self-realization. Rooted in Vedic traditions, TM involves silent mantra repetition to achieve transcendence. Popularized in the West by celebrities like the Beatles, it operates through global centers offering courses and retreats. TM emphasizes scientific benefits, appealing to seekers of personal growth and mental clarity, often independent of religious affiliation.
## View on God
TM is non-theistic, viewing divinity as a universal consciousness accessible through meditation, not a personal god.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal harmony and compassion. Moral codes include nonviolence, truth, and self-improvement. Taboos involve stress and negativity, seen as barriers to transcendence.
## Demographics
Approximately 5–6 million practitioners, primarily in the US, Europe, and India. Growth is steady through global outreach.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine, respected for compassion. Christianity is seen as compatible but secondary to TM’s universal approach.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is not emphasized; reincarnation may align with Vedic roots. No heaven or hell; meditation focuses on present-life transcendence.
