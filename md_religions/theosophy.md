text# Theosophy
## Introduction
Theosophy is an esoteric movement founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky in the United States, blending Western occultism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. It emphasizes universal spiritual truths, karma, and spiritual evolution through esoteric knowledge.
## View on God
Theosophy is pantheistic, viewing the divine as an impersonal, infinite Universal Principle or Absolute. No personal God exists; deities from various traditions are symbolic emanations of this cosmic unity.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual growth, compassion, and universal brotherhood. Moral codes promote nonviolence, truth, and selflessness, with practices like meditation fostering enlightenment. Taboos include selfishness and harming others.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000â€“50,000 adherents, primarily in the US, India, and Europe, through groups like the Theosophical Society. Growth is limited due to its intellectual focus.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Theosophy views Jesus as an enlightened master or avatar, not uniquely divine, equivalent to figures like Buddha. Christianity is seen as one path among many, with Theosophists reinterpreting Jesus through esoteric lenses, rejecting orthodox doctrines.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
Theosophy believes in reincarnation and karma, with the soul (monad) cycling through lives to achieve spiritual evolution. After death, the soul enters a transitional state (Devachan) for reflection, then reincarnates. No eternal heaven/hell; meditation and ethical living prepare the soul for higher states.[^19][^20]
