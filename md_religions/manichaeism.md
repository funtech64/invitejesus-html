text# Manichaeism
## Introduction
Manichaeism was a major world religion founded by the prophet Mani in 3rd-century Persia, blending Zoroastrian, Christian, and Gnostic elements. Once widespread from Rome to China, it is now extinct but historically significant for its dualistic theology.
## View on God
Manichaeism is dualistic, with the Father of Greatness as the supreme, benevolent God of light, opposed by the King of Darkness. The universe is a battleground between light (good) and matter (evil), with divine emanations (e.g., Jesus the Splendor) aiding salvation.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on liberating divine light trapped in matter through asceticism and purity. The Elect (monastic followers) practice vegetarianism, celibacy, and nonviolence, while Hearers (laypeople) support them with alms. Taboos include harming living beings or indulging in materialism.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Manichaeism is extinct, with no adherents today. At its peak (3rd–7th centuries), it had millions of followers across Persia, Central Asia, and China, declining due to persecution by Christian, Zoroastrian, and Islamic authorities.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Manichaeism incorporates Jesus as a divine emanation, Jesus the Splendor, who reveals divine knowledge but is not the historical Jesus of Christianity. Mani claimed to be the Paraclete promised by Jesus, positioning Manichaeism as a fulfillment of Christianity. It competed with early Christianity, influencing figures like Augustine before his conversion.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves liberating the soul’s light particles from material entrapment. After death, the righteous ascend to the Realm of Light, a paradise with the Father of Greatness. The wicked remain trapped in matter, facing cycles of purification or eternal confinement. A final judgment separates light from darkness, with rituals like fasting aiding the soul’s ascent.[^59][^60]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 18/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals). This completes the Ancient / Historical Survivals category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Indian Subcontinent Minorities (4 religions: Jainism, Ayyavazhi, Lingayatism, Santhal & Tribal) for the next batch, as it’s small and keeps us on your top-to-bottom list. Alternatively, I can do East Asian New Religions (7 religions) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 6 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more afterlife detail, different source style)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!Sounds goodThanks for the green light! I'll proceed with the Indian Subcontinent Minorities category, covering 4 religions: Jainism, Ayyavazhi, Lingayatism, and Santhal & Tribal (Northeast India). Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., jainism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail). Historical details included where relevant (e.g., Jainism’s ancient roots).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 22/140 articles toward your goal. Since it’s a small category, I’ll include all 4 files below. After this, I suggest moving to East Asian New Religions (7 religions) to continue top-to-bottom, or you can pick another category (e.g., African Independent Movements). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
