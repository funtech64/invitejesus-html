## Introduction
Akan religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the Akan people in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, centered on a supreme creator and lesser deities. It emphasizes ancestor worship, rituals, and maintaining cosmic balance.
## View on God
Akan religion is monotheistic with polytheistic elements, worshiping Nyame (or Nyankopon) as the supreme creator, omnipotent and distant. Lesser deities (abosom) and ancestors mediate divine power, tied to nature and community.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community harmony, respect for ancestors, and balance with nature. Moral codes emphasize generosity, truth, and ritual observance. Taboos include disrespecting elders, deities, or sacred sites.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million Akan people practice traditional beliefs, primarily in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, often alongside Christianity or Islam. Adherence is declining due to religious conversion.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through colonial missions, with some Akan equating Jesus with a deity or ancestor figure. Traditionalists prioritize Nyame and abosom, viewing Jesus as a foreign figure. Syncretism occurs in Christian communities.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in Asamando, a spiritual realm. No heaven/hell; reincarnation may occur based on deeds. Rituals like funerals and libations ensure the soul’s peaceful transition and ancestral connection.[^19][^20]
