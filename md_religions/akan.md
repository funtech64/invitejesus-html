# Akan Religion

## Introduction
Akan religion, known as Akom, is the traditional belief system of the Akan people of Ghana and eastern Ivory Coast. It centers on a supreme deity, ancestor worship, and a pantheon of lesser gods, often syncretized with Christianity.

## View on God
Akan religion is polytheistic with a monotheistic core. The supreme deity, Nyame (or Nyankopon), is the creator, omnipotent, and distant, rarely interacting directly with humans. Lesser deities (abosom) and spirits serve as intermediaries, overseeing natural forces and human affairs. Ancestors and nature spirits also play significant roles.[^24][^25]

## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is a continuation of existence in a spiritual realm. The soul (okra) survives death, joining ancestors in Asamando, a spiritual world where the dead maintain influence over the living. Good conduct ensures ancestral status; evil deeds may lead to spiritual unrest or exclusion. Rituals, including libations and offerings, maintain connections with ancestors, who are believed to guide and protect families. There is no strict heaven/hell dichotomy; instead, the afterlife reflects one’s earthly life, with ancestors judging moral behavior.[^26][^27]

## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on communal harmony and respect for Nyame’s creation. Virtues include truthfulness, hospitality, and respect for elders and ancestors. Moral codes are reinforced through proverbs and taboos, with divination used to resolve ethical dilemmas. The concept of musuo (taboos) governs behavior, prohibiting actions like disrespecting sacred sites.[^28][^29]

## Demographics
Approximately 5-10 million Akan people practice Akom, primarily in Ghana and Ivory Coast. Most Akan (~70%) identify as Christian, with traditional practices often syncretized. Purely traditional adherents are declining (~10-20% of Akan), concentrated in rural areas.[^30][^31]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Akan religion has been heavily influenced by Christianity since the 19th century, with many Akan converting while retaining traditional practices. Nyame is sometimes equated with the Christian God, facilitating syncretism. Jesus is often viewed as a powerful spiritual figure or intermediary, akin to an abosom or revered ancestor, but not central to Akom theology. In syncretic contexts, Christian prayers or symbols may be incorporated into Akan rituals, but traditionalists focus on Nyame and abosom without emphasizing Jesus.[^32][^33]
