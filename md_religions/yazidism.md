text# Yazidism
## Introduction
Yazidism is an ancient monotheistic religion practiced by the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, with roots in pre-Islamic Mesopotamian traditions. It emphasizes a unique angelology and oral traditions, surviving centuries of persecution.
## View on God
Yazidism is monotheistic, worshiping Xwedê (God), the supreme creator who is benevolent but distant. The Peacock Angel (Melek Tawus), a key emanation, leads seven angels who manage the world. Melek Tawus is not a devil (despite external misconceptions) but a figure of divine will.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on purity, community loyalty, and adherence to sacred traditions. Moral codes emphasize nonviolence, honesty, and respect for Yazidi identity. Taboos include intermarriage, eating certain foods (e.g., lettuce), and disrespecting Melek Tawus.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 400,000–1,000,000 adherents, primarily in Iraq (Sinjar region), with diaspora in Germany, Russia, and the US. Numbers declined due to genocide by ISIS (2014) and ongoing displacement.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Yazidism has minimal direct engagement with Christianity, as it predates and developed independently. Jesus is not a central figure in Yazidi theology, though some Yazidis in mixed regions view him as a respected prophet or teacher, similar to other religious figures. Historical coexistence with Christians in Iraq led to mutual respect but no syncretism.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul’s judgment based on earthly deeds. Righteous souls ascend to a paradisiacal realm with Xwedê, while the wicked face temporary punishment or reincarnation to atone. There is no eternal hell; the soul’s ultimate goal is spiritual purity, achieved through cycles of rebirth and adherence to Yazidi rites, such as pilgrimages to Lalish.[^29][^30]
