text# Mesopotamian
## Introduction
Mesopotamian religion, practiced in ancient Sumer, Babylon, and Assyria (circa 3000–300 BCE), was a polytheistic tradition centered on deities controlling natural and social forces. It influenced later Abrahamic religions through myths and laws.
## View on God
Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic, with gods like Anu (sky), Enlil (storm), and Inanna (love/war) governing cosmic and human affairs. No supreme deity dominated; gods were anthropomorphic, interacting with humans.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on pleasing the gods through rituals and moral behavior. Moral codes included loyalty, justice, and offerings to avoid divine wrath. Taboos involved blasphemy, neglecting rituals, or violating social order.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 1st century CE. Historically practiced by millions in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Some modern neo-pagan revivals exist but are negligible.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Mesopotamian religion predates Christianity but influenced it through myths (e.g., flood stories) and legal traditions. Jesus, as a Christian figure, had no role in Mesopotamian theology, though early Christians adapted Mesopotamian concepts like angels and demons.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife was a gloomy underworld (Irkalla) where souls lived as shades, regardless of deeds. No heaven/hell; the focus was on earthly divine favor. Rituals like burials and offerings ensured the dead’s comfort in Irkalla, with elite souls potentially serving gods.[^9][^10]
