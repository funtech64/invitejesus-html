text# Seicho-No-Ie
## Introduction
Seicho-No-Ie, founded in 1930 by Masaharu Taniguchi in Japan, is a new religious movement blending Shinto, Buddhism, and Christian elements, emphasizing positive thinking.
## View on God
Seicho-No-Ie is monistic, viewing God as universal life force within all. No personal deity is central.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on gratitude and harmony. Moral codes include positive thinking, love, and service. Taboos involve negativity and harm.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000–1 million followers, primarily in Japan and Brazil. Growth is modest.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is incorporated as a universal truth.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; positive thinking prepares the soul.[^30]

Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., more New Religious Movements like Oomoto, Mahikari) or any tweaks, and I’ll generate the next 6 articles to keep us on track for 300!Continue,
When a movement is 2% of the world population than please make a 500-750 word article.Got it! We're targeting 300 religions from the YAML taxonomy, with 170/300 articles completed. For this batch, I'll cover 6 more lesser-known New Religious Movements from the YAML: Oomoto, Mahikari, Agon Shu, God Light Association (GLA), Church of Perfect Liberty, and Aetherius Society. Articles will be concise (~100–150 words) in Markdown format for the /religions/ folder, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs, unless a movement exceeds 2% of the world population, in which case it will be 500–750 words. None of these movements meet the 2% threshold (~160 million people, based on a global population of ~8 billion), so all will be short. This batch brings us to 176/300 articles. I'll keep the structure consistent: Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, with neutral, academic sources.
