# Native American Religions

## Introduction
Native American religions encompass diverse traditions of over 500 indigenous nations in North America, emphasizing harmony with nature, oral histories, and communal rituals. They vary by tribe but share themes of animism and reverence for the land.

## View on God
Many traditions are animistic and polytheistic, with a Great Spirit or Creator (e.g., Wakan Tanka in Lakota, Gitche Manitou in Ojibwe) as a supreme force. Spirits inhabit all things; no single anthropomorphic God, but a pervasive divine energy.[^44][^45]

## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize balance with nature, community responsibility, and respect for all life. Moral codes promote virtues like generosity, courage, and humility, guided by elders and stories. Taboos include waste or disrespecting sacred sites.[^46][^47]

## Demographics
Approximately 4-6 million indigenous people in the US and Canada practice traditional religions, often blended with Christianity. About 10-20% identify solely with traditional beliefs; declining due to assimilation.[^48][^49]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Historical forced conversions led to syncretism (e.g., Native American Church blending peyote with Christian elements). Many view Jesus as a spiritual teacher or prophet, but traditionalists resist, seeing Christianity as incompatible with animism.[^50][^51]

## View on Afterlife
The afterlife varies; many believe in a spirit world where souls continue, with good lives leading to harmony, evil to unrest. No universal heaven/hell; reincarnation or ancestral guidance common, rituals ensure peaceful transition.[^52][^53]
