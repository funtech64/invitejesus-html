text# Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
## Introduction
The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in 1888 in the UK, is an esoteric movement blending occultism, Kabbalah, and ritual magic for spiritual enlightenment.
## View on God
The Order is polytheistic, recognizing a universal divine accessed through mystical practices. No single deity is central.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual growth and self-knowledge. Moral codes include discipline, study, and ritual. Taboos involve misuse of power.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000â€“5,000 followers, primarily in the UK and US. Growth is limited by its initiatory nature.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a symbolic figure, not divine. Christianity is reinterpreted esoterically.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^5]
