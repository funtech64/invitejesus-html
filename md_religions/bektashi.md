## Introduction
The Bektashi Order, founded in the 13th century by Haji Bektash Veli in Turkey, is a Sufi order blending Shia and Sunni elements, emphasizing mysticism and tolerance.
## View on God
Bektashi is monotheistic, worshiping Allah. Mystical practices emphasize divine unity.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and tolerance. Moral codes include charity, humility, and ritual. Taboos involve intolerance.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“3 million followers, primarily in Turkey and the Balkans. Growth is modest.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a prophet, not divine, per Islamic belief. Christianity is respected.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic beliefs: paradise or hell. Sufi rituals prepare the soul.[^25]
