text# Christian Science
## Introduction
Christian Science is a religious movement founded in 1879 by Mary Baker Eddy in the United States. It emphasizes healing through prayer and a metaphysical understanding of Christianity, based on Eddy’s *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures*.
## View on God
Christian Science is monotheistic, worshiping God as an infinite, spiritual principle (Mind, Spirit, Soul). The Trinity is reinterpreted metaphysically, with Jesus as the human expression of the divine Christ.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual purity, love, and healing. Moral codes emphasize truth, charity, and overcoming sin through prayer. Taboos include reliance on medicine over spiritual healing and materialistic thinking.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–400,000 adherents, primarily in the US, with communities in Europe and Australia. Declining due to controversy over medical practices and aging membership.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christian Science identifies as Christian, viewing Jesus as the Way-shower who demonstrated divine healing. Christ is the spiritual idea of God, not a person, distinguishing it from mainstream Christianity, which often questions its orthodoxy.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is spiritual, not physical, with the soul continuing in God’s infinite reality. No literal heaven/hell; the righteous experience eternal harmony, while the wicked face correction through spiritual understanding. Prayer and study prepare the soul for eternal life.[^29][^30]
