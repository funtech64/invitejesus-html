text# Fundamentalist LDS
## Introduction
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), branching from Mormonism in the early 20th century, is a Christian sect emphasizing polygamy and strict adherence to early LDS teachings. Led by figures like Warren Jeffs, it maintains isolated communities, rejecting mainstream LDS changes like the 1890 polygamy ban. Members practice communal living, modest dress, and patriarchal governance, with worship centered on temples and home study. The FLDS emerged from disputes over doctrine, appealing to those committed to Joseph Smith’s original revelations despite legal and social controversies.
## View on God
FLDS is monotheistic, worshiping one God. Jesus is divine, the Son of God, with Joseph Smith as a prophet.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on obedience to prophetic teachings. Moral codes include polygamy, modesty, and charity. Taboos involve apostasy and secular influences.
## Demographics
Approximately 6,000–10,000 followers, primarily in the US (Utah, Arizona). Growth is limited due to legal issues.[^11]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central as Savior. FLDS identifies as Christian but is distinct from mainstream Christianity due to unique doctrines.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves celestial kingdoms for the faithful. Polygamy and rituals prepare the soul for exaltation; the wicked face judgment.
