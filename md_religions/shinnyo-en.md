text# Shinnyo-en
## Introduction
Shinnyo-en, founded in 1936 by Shinjo Ito in Japan, is a Buddhist-derived religion emphasizing meditation and spiritual purification, rooted in Shingon Buddhism.
## View on God
Shinnyo-en is non-theistic, focusing on Buddha-nature and Nirvana. No personal God; spiritual energy is central.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion and purification. Moral codes include meditation, service, and harmony. Taboos involve harm and egoism.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000–1 million followers, primarily in Japan, with global centers. Growth is steady.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a moral teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but distinct from Shinnyo-en’s Buddhist focus.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until Nirvana. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for liberation.[^25]
