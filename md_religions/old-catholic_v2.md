text# Old Catholic
## Introduction
The Old Catholic Church, emerging in the 1870s in Europe, is a Christian denomination rejecting papal infallibility while preserving Catholic liturgy and sacraments. Formed after the First Vatican Council, it emphasizes autonomy, local governance, and traditional worship. Congregations, led by bishops, practice the Eucharist and baptism, appealing to those seeking Catholicism without centralized papal authority. Old Catholics maintain apostolic succession and engage in ecumenical dialogue, balancing tradition with progressive values like inclusivity.
## View on God
Old Catholicism is monotheistic, worshiping one God in Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Jesus is divine.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and tradition. Moral codes include charity, sacraments, and inclusivity. Taboos involve heresy and exclusion.
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in Europe (Netherlands, Germany). Growth is modest.[^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central, divine, and part of the Trinity. Old Catholicism aligns closely with broader Christianity.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves heaven or hell, with purgatory. Sacraments like the Eucharist prepare the soul for salvation.

text# Andean Inti
## Introduction
Andean Inti worship is a traditional religion of the Andean peoples, centered on Inti, the sun god, as the source of life and energy. Originating in the Inca Empire, it integrates cosmology with agriculture, with festivals like Inti Raymi involving offerings and dances to ensure harvests. Sacred sites like Machu Picchu serve as temples, where priests conduct rituals. Despite Spanish colonization, Inti worship persists among Quechua and Aymara communities, often blended with Catholicism.
## View on God
Andean Inti worship is polytheistic, venerating Inti as the primary deity alongside Viracocha (creator) and Pachamama (earth). Divinity is immanent in the sun and natural cycles.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on reciprocity (ayni) and harmony. Moral codes include offerings to Inti, community cooperation, and environmental care. Taboos involve neglecting rituals or harming nature.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million followers, primarily in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Growth is tied to Indigenous populations, with revival efforts.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized with Inti as a solar symbol or divine figure. Christianity is widely integrated, with Inti festivals coinciding with Christian holidays.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves souls joining ancestors in spiritual realms or reincarnating. No heaven or hell; offerings and rituals ensure cosmic balance for the soul.[^4]
