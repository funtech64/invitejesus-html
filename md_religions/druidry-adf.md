text# Druidry (√År nDra√≠ocht F√©in)
## Introduction
√År nDra√≠ocht F√©in (ADF), founded in 1983 by Isaac Bonewits in the US, is a neo-pagan Druidry movement emphasizing Celtic and Indo-European spirituality.
## View on God
ADF Druidry is polytheistic, worshiping deities like Lugh or Brigid. Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on hospitality and environmentalism. Moral codes include community, ritual, and respect. Taboos involve harm and disrespect.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000‚Äì10,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its structured approach.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but distinct from ADF‚Äôs pagan focus.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or an Otherworld. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul for spiritual cycles.[^30]

Progress
Completed: 188/300 articles (182 previous + 6 new).
Remaining: 112 articles from the YAML taxonomy.
Next Batch: I‚Äôll continue with 6 more Neo-Paganism groups from the YAML (e.g., Heathenry (√Åsatr√∫), Heathenry (The Troth), Rodnovery, Kemeticism, Hellenism (Reconstructionist), Roman Reconstructionism). Let me know if you prefer a different category (e.g., Sufism, Indigenous) or any tweaks, and I‚Äôll generate the next set!
Doing good, let‚Äôs continue!! üòÄLoving the enthusiasm! üòÑ We're at 188/300 articles from the YAML taxonomy. This batch covers 6 more lesser-known Neo-Paganism groups from the YAML: Heathenry (√Åsatr√∫), Heathenry (The Troth), Rodnovery, Kemeticism, Hellenism (Reconstructionist), and Roman Reconstructionism. Articles are concise (~100‚Äì150 words), in Markdown format for the /religions/ folder, with lowercase, hyphenated slugs. None exceed 2% of the world population (~160 million), so all remain short. This brings us to 194/300 articles. Structure stays consistent: Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, with neutral, academic sources.
