text# Art of Living Foundation
## Introduction
The Art of Living Foundation, founded in 1981 by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in India, promotes spiritual growth through meditation, yoga, and breathing techniques (Sudarshan Kriya).
## View on God
The Foundation is non-theistic, viewing divinity as universal consciousness. No personal God is central; spirituality is experiential.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion and inner peace. Moral codes include nonviolence, service, and meditation. Taboos involve harm and negativity.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million followers, primarily in India, the US, and Europe. Growth is steady, tied to wellness movements.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected as a parallel path to universal spirituality.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or spiritual liberation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for unity.[^20]
