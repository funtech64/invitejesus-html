text# Wicca (Alexandrian)
## Introduction
Alexandrian Wicca, founded in the 1960s by Alex Sanders in the UK, is a neo-pagan religion derived from Gardnerian Wicca, emphasizing ceremonial magic and ritual.
## View on God
Alexandrian Wicca is polytheistic, worshiping a Horned God and Triple Goddess. Divinity is immanent, tied to nature and cycles.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics follow the Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will." Moral codes include freedom, ritual purity, and respect. Taboos involve harm and manipulation.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 followers, primarily in the UK and US. Growth is limited by its initiatory nature.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often distanced due to historical pagan tensions.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or a Summerland realm. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul for spiritual cycles.[^10]
