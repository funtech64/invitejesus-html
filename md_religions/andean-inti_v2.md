text# Andean Inti
## Introduction
Andean Inti worship, practiced by Indigenous peoples in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, is a traditional religion centered on Inti, the sun god, revered as the source of life and fertility. Originating in the Inca Empire, this faith integrates cosmology with agricultural cycles, with festivals like Inti Raymi celebrating solar renewal. Priests, or *yayas*, conduct rituals at sacred sites like Machu Picchu, offering coca leaves and chicha to honor Inti and ensure prosperity. Despite colonial suppression, Inti worship persists among Quechua and Aymara communities, often blending with Catholic elements.
## View on God
Andean Inti worship is polytheistic, venerating Inti as the primary deity alongside Viracocha (creator god) and other spirits like mountain *apus*. Divinity permeates nature, with Inti symbolizing life and energy.
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize reciprocity (*ayni*) and harmony with nature. Moral codes include offerings to Inti, community cooperation, and environmental stewardship. Taboos involve neglecting rituals or harming sacred sites, believed to disrupt cosmic balance.
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million followers practice Inti worship, primarily in Peru and Bolivia. Growth is tied to Indigenous populations, with revival efforts countering historical decline.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized with Inti or Viracocha, viewed as a divine figure or solar symbol. Christianity, introduced by Spanish colonizers, is widely integrated, with many Andeans practicing both faiths in parallel.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms where souls join ancestors or deities. There is no heaven or hell; rituals like coca offerings ensure cosmic harmony and a peaceful transition for the soul.
