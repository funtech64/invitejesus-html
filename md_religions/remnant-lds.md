text# Remnant Church of Jesus Christ
## Introduction
The Remnant Church of Jesus Christ, founded in 2000 in Missouri, is a Christian restorationist sect splitting from the Community of Christ, emphasizing a return to Joseph Smith’s original teachings. Rejecting modern LDS changes, it focuses on scripture, temple worship, and preparing for Christ’s return. Members meet in small congregations, practicing baptism and communal living, with a strong emphasis on prophetic guidance and Book of Mormon teachings. The Remnant Church appeals to those seeking a purer form of early Mormonism.
## View on God
The Remnant Church is monotheistic, worshiping one God. Jesus is divine, the Son of God, with Joseph Smith as a prophet.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on scriptural obedience. Moral codes include charity, modesty, and community. Taboos involve apostasy and worldly influences.
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–2,000 followers, primarily in the US (Missouri). Growth is limited due to its niche focus.[^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central as Savior. The Church identifies as Christian, distinct from mainstream Christianity due to restorationist beliefs.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves celestial kingdoms for the faithful. Rituals prepare the soul for exaltation; the wicked face judgment.
