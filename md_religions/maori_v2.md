## Introduction
Māori religion, practiced by the Māori people of New Zealand, is a traditional faith emphasizing gods like Tāne (forest) and Papatūānuku (earth), rooted in *whakapapa* (genealogy). It involves rituals like *powhiri* (welcomes) and carvings at *marae* (meeting houses) to maintain *tapu* (sacredness). Suppressed during colonization, it persists through cultural revival in dances, tattoos (*ta moko*), and storytelling, often blended with Christianity. The religion underscores a deep connection to land and ancestors.
## View on God
Māori religion is polytheistic, venerating gods like Tāne, Tangaroa (sea), and Ranginui (sky). Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestral spirits.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on *kaitiakitanga* (guardianship) and *mana* (prestige). Moral codes include respect for elders, hospitality, and rituals. Taboos involve violating *tapu* or disrespecting ancestors.
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in New Zealand, with many blending with Christianity. Growth is tied to Māori cultural revival.[^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a spirit or prophet, sometimes aligned with Tāne. Christianity, introduced by missionaries, is integrated, with Māori practices coexisting.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves *Hawaiki* (ancestral homeland) or spiritual realms, with possible reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals like *tangi* (funerals) ensure the soul’s peace.
