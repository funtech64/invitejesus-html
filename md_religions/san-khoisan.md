text# San/Khoisan Traditional Beliefs
## Introduction
San (Bushmen) and Khoisan traditional beliefs are the indigenous spiritualities of the San and Khoi peoples of Southern Africa, focusing on spirits, ancestors, and the natural world. They are expressed through rock art, storytelling, and trance dances.
## View on God
San religion is animistic with a creator deity, ≠Gao N!a (or Cagn in some groups), who shapes the world but is not central to daily worship. Spirits of the dead and nature (e.g., animals, stars) are revered, with shamans accessing them via trance.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize harmony with nature and community survival. Moral codes promote sharing, respect for animals, and humility. Taboos include wasting resources or disrespecting spirits, with trance dances guiding moral behavior.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000-150,000 San/Khoisan practice traditional beliefs, primarily in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. Most (~70%) combine with Christianity; purely traditional adherents are declining due to displacement.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through colonial missions, with some equating ≠Gao N!a with the Christian God. Jesus is seen as a spiritual figure but peripheral; traditionalists prioritize spirits and ancestors, often resisting Christian dominance.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spirits joining the ancestral realm, often in the sky or sacred landscapes. No heaven/hell; spirits influence the living through dreams or trance. Rituals like healing dances ensure peaceful transitions.[^69][^70]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 12/15 Indigenous & Folk religions (Shinto, Yoruba, Akan, Santería, Candomblé, Umbanda, Haitian Vodou, Native American religions, Aboriginal Australian, Māori, Pacific Islander, Dinka, Zulu, Maasai, San/Khoisan). This brings us to 12/140 toward your goal.
Next Category: I suggest moving to Ancient / Historical Survivals (6 religions: Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, Yazidism, Samaritanism, Druze, Manichaeism) for the next batch, as it’s compact and aligns with your top-to-bottom approach. Alternatively, I can do a larger batch like Indian Subcontinent Minorities (4 religions) or East Asian New Religions (7 religions).
Batch Size: I provided 7 files here (slightly more than the 5-6 suggested to balance progress). I can continue with ~5-7 per response to stay within limits. Confirm if this works or if you prefer fewer/more.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone seem to fit. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on afterlife, less on ethics, different source style)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where academically reliable). Want to add or exclude any sources?
Let me know your preferences for the next batch and any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Looks goodGlad you’re happy with the format and tone! I’ll move forward with the next category, Ancient / Historical Survivals, covering 6 religions: Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, Yazidism, Samaritanism, Druze, and Manichaeism. These will follow the same Markdown structure as before:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., zoroastrianism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics (emphasized for smaller religions), Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail). Historical details included since these are Abrahamic or Abrahamic-adjacent.
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics, history, and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 18/140 articles toward your goal. I’ll generate all 6 files below to keep the response manageable. After this, I can proceed to the next category (e.g., Indian Subcontinent Minorities) or another of your choice. Let me know if you want tweaks or a specific next batch!
