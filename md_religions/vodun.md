text# Vodun (West Africa)
## Introduction
Vodun, originating in West Africa among the Fon and Ewe, is a traditional religion emphasizing spirits (Vodun) and ancestral worship.
## View on God
Vodun is polytheistic, worshiping Mawu-Lisa as the supreme creator alongside spirits like Legba. Divinity is immanent.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and harmony. Moral codes include respect, ritual, and offerings. Taboos involve disrespecting spirits.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 10â€“15 million followers, primarily in Benin and Togo. Growth is steady.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a foreign figure, sometimes syncretized. Christianity is blended in some communities.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^25]
