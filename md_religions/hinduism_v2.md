## Introduction
Hinduism, one of the worldâ€™s oldest religions, originated in the Indian subcontinent over 4,000 years ago. A diverse, polytheistic faith, it encompasses traditions like Vaishnavism and Shaivism, with no single founder. Hindus worship in temples, homes, and festivals like Diwali, using rituals like *puja* and yoga. It has shaped Indian culture, philosophy, and arts, influencing global spirituality through texts like the Bhagavad Gita.
## History
Hinduism evolved from Vedic traditions (1500 BCE), with texts like the Rigveda. The Upanishads introduced philosophical concepts like karma. Classical Hinduism developed through epics like the Mahabharata. Colonialism and reform movements like Arya Samaj modernized it. Today, Hinduism thrives globally, especially in India and the diaspora.
## View on God
Hinduism is polytheistic or monistic, venerating deities like Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi, with Brahman as the ultimate reality.
## View on Ethics
Ethics stem from *dharma* (duty). Moral codes include nonviolence (*ahimsa*), truth, and family duty. Taboos involve harming life or violating caste norms.
## Practices
Practices include *puja* (worship), meditation, yoga, and festivals. Pilgrimages to sites like Varanasi are common.
## Key Texts
The Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Ramayana are central, guiding philosophy and practice.
## Demographics
Approximately 1.2 billion followers (15%), primarily in India and Nepal. Growth is steady in the diaspora.[^11]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is respected as a spiritual teacher or avatar in some Hindu traditions. Christianity is seen as a valid path but distinct.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation based on karma, aiming for *moksha* (liberation). No eternal hell; rituals aid spiritual progress.
