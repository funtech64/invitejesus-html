text# Jehovah’s Witnesses
## Introduction
Jehovah’s Witnesses is a Christian denomination founded in the late 19th century by Charles Taze Russell in the United States. It emphasizes strict adherence to biblical teachings, door-to-door evangelism, and preparation for God’s kingdom.
## View on God
Jehovah’s Witnesses are strictly monotheistic, worshiping Jehovah as the one true God, rejecting the Trinity. Jesus is God’s first creation, not divine, and the Holy Spirit is God’s active force, not a person.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on biblical commandments, emphasizing obedience to Jehovah, honesty, and moral purity. Moral codes include avoiding blood transfusions, shunning apostates, and promoting family values. Taboos include idolatry, immorality, and worldly associations.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 8–9 million adherents globally, with significant presence in the US, Brazil, Mexico, and Europe. Growth is steady due to active proselytizing, though retention is challenged by strict practices.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jehovah’s Witnesses identify as Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God and savior, but not God himself. Jesus’ death provides atonement, and he rules as king in God’s coming kingdom. They reject mainstream Christian doctrines like the Trinity and eternal hell.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
After death, most souls await resurrection on a paradise Earth after Armageddon, where the righteous live forever. A select 144,000 “anointed” believers rule with Jesus in heaven. The wicked are annihilated, not sent to hell. Memorial services and Bible study prepare believers for resurrection.[^9][^10]
