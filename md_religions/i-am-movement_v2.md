The I AM Movement, founded in 1930 by Guy and Edna Ballard in the US, emphasizes the divine “I AM” presence and Ascended Masters for spiritual growth.
## View on God
The movement is monotheistic, viewing God as the “I AM” presence within all. Ascended Masters guide.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and ascension. Moral codes include positive decrees and love. Taboos involve negativity.[^22]

Approximately 10,000–50,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited.[^23]

Jesus is an Ascended Master, not uniquely divine. Christianity is reinterpreted.[^24]
