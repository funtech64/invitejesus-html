text# Lakota Sun Dance
## Introduction
The Lakota Sun Dance is a traditional ceremony of the Lakota people in the US Great Plains, involving sacrifice, renewal, and spiritual connection to Wakan Tanka.
## View on God
The Sun Dance is monotheistic, worshipping Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit) as the supreme creator, with lesser spirits in nature.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community sacrifice and harmony. Moral codes include respect, prayer, and offerings. Taboos involve disrespecting sacred rituals.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000 adherents practicing the Sun Dance, primarily in South Dakota and Montana. Growth is tied to Lakota population.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit or healer. Christianity is integrated in some Lakota communities.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm where souls join ancestors. No heaven or hell; the Sun Dance renews spiritual energy and prepares the soul for eternal harmony with Wakan Tanka.[^10]
