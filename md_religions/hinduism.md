text# Hinduism
## Introduction
Hinduism is one of the world’s oldest religions, originating in India over 3,000 years ago. A diverse, polytheistic tradition, it is based on texts like the Vedas and Upanishads, emphasizing dharma and spiritual liberation.
## View on God
Hinduism is polytheistic or monistic, with many gods (e.g., Vishnu, Shiva, Devi) seen as manifestations of Brahman, the ultimate reality. Practitioners may focus on one deity while acknowledging others, with God as both personal and impersonal.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are guided by dharma (cosmic order), emphasizing duty, nonviolence (ahimsa), and truth. Moral codes vary by caste and tradition but include charity and purity. Taboos include harming living beings and violating dharma.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 1.2 billion adherents (15% of global population), primarily in India, Nepal, and diaspora communities (US, UK, Southeast Asia). Growth is stable, driven by India’s population.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Hinduism has minimal direct engagement with Christianity. Jesus is often seen as an avatar or enlightened teacher, akin to Krishna, but not central. Some Hindus (e.g., in ISKCON) respect Jesus’ teachings, but Christianity is distinct from Hindu cosmology.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation (samsara) driven by karma, with souls cycling through births until achieving moksha (liberation). Moksha is union with Brahman, transcending material existence. No eternal hell; rituals like puja and meditation prepare the soul for liberation.[^29][^30]
