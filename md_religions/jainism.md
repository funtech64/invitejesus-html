text# Jainism
## Introduction
Jainism is an ancient Indian religion, originating in the 6th century BCE, emphasizing nonviolence (ahimsa), asceticism, and spiritual liberation. Founded by Mahavira (24th Tirthankara), it is one of India’s oldest traditions, influencing Hindu and Buddhist thought.
## View on God
Jainism is nontheistic, rejecting a creator God. Instead, it venerates liberated souls (siddhas) and spiritual teachers (Tirthankaras), who achieve omniscience through asceticism. The universe is eternal, governed by natural laws (karma), not a divine being. Every soul has divine potential to attain liberation (moksha).[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are centered on ahimsa (nonviolence to all living beings), truthfulness (satya), non-stealing (asteya), chastity (brahmacharya), and non-attachment (aparigraha). Jains practice strict vegetarianism, avoid harming even microorganisms, and follow ascetic disciplines. Monks adhere to rigorous vows, while laypeople adapt them to daily life.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 4–6 million adherents, primarily in India (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan), with small diaspora communities in the US, UK, and Canada. Stable but not growing significantly due to its non-proselytizing nature.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jainism has minimal direct engagement with Christianity, as it predates it and focuses on its own soteriology. Jesus is not referenced in Jain texts, but some modern Jains view him as a moral teacher whose emphasis on compassion aligns with ahimsa. Historical interactions were limited, though Christian missionaries in India (19th century) occasionally dialogued with Jains. Jainism’s nontheistic stance makes it distinct from Christianity’s monotheism.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Jainism believes in a cycle of rebirth (samsara) driven by karma, with no eternal heaven or hell. Souls accumulate karma through actions, reincarnating into various forms (human, animal, divine, or hellish beings) across infinite cycles. Liberation (moksha) is achieved by shedding all karma through asceticism, leading to eternal bliss in Siddhaloka, a non-physical realm of liberated souls. Rituals like sallekhana (voluntary fasting to death) prepare the soul for liberation, while daily practices like meditation reduce karmic bonds.[^9][^10]
