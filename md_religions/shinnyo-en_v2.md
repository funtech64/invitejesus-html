text# Shinnyo-en
## Introduction
Shinnyo-en, founded in 1936 by Shinjo Ito in Japan, is a Buddhist-derived movement emphasizing enlightenment through meditation and compassion.
## View on God
Shinnyo-en is non-theistic, focusing on Nirvana and Buddha-nature. Spiritual energy is central.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion and purity. Moral codes include meditation and service. Taboos involve harm and egoism.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 1 million followers, primarily in Japan. Growth is steady.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until Nirvana. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^10]
