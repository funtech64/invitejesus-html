text# Zapotec
## Introduction
Zapotec religion, practiced in Mesoamerica (circa 700 BCE–1500 CE), was a polytheistic tradition of the Zapotec people in Oaxaca, Mexico. It emphasized deities, ancestors, and cosmic balance, preserved in archaeological records.
## View on God
Zapotec religion was polytheistic, with deities like Cozobi (maize) and Pitao Cozobi (creator). No single supreme deity; gods and spirits were tied to nature and ancestors.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on community harmony and divine appeasement. Moral codes emphasized ritual observance and respect for ancestors. Taboos included neglecting deities or disrupting cosmic order.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 16th century CE. Historically practiced by thousands in Oaxaca. Modern Zapotec (500,000–1 million) blend practices with Catholicism.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Spanish colonization introduced Christianity, with some Zapotec equating Jesus with creator deities. Traditionalists prioritized Zapotec gods, but syncretism is common in modern communities.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife likely involved a spiritual realm where souls joined ancestors or deities. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured safe passage and cosmic harmony.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 128/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions + 5 East Asian Traditional Religions + 5 Afro-Caribbean Religions + 5 Ancient Mediterranean Religions + 5 Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions). This completes the Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to European Pagan Religions (5 religions: Norse, Celtic, Baltic, Slavic, Finnish) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. This would bring us to 133/140, leaving room to cover the remaining 7 articles in a final batch (e.g., Jainism, Bahá’í, or other small faiths). Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Modern Spiritual Movements) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., European Pagan Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!yes pleaseThanks for the continued enthusiasm! I'll proceed with the European Pagan Religions category, covering 5 religions: Norse, Celtic, Baltic, Slavic, and Finnish. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., norse.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 133/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest covering the remaining 7 articles in a final batch, potentially including Jainism, Bahá’í, Samaritanism, Mandaeism, Yazidism, Ayyavazhi, and Sant Mat to wrap up key remaining faiths from the 300-list taxonomy. Alternatively, we can revisit earlier categories for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
