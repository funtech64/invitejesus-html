text# Polynesian Traditions
## Introduction
Polynesian traditions encompass the indigenous spiritual practices of Polynesian peoples across islands like Samoa, Tonga, and Tahiti. They emphasize deities, ancestors, and harmony with nature, preserved through oral traditions and rituals.
## View on God
Polynesian religion is polytheistic and animistic, with deities like Tangaloa (creator) and Maui (trickster). Spirits (aitu) inhabit nature and ancestors, with no single supreme God.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on mana (spiritual power), respect for community, and nature. Moral codes emphasize hospitality, reciprocity, and ritual observance. Taboos include violating sacred sites or disrespecting ancestors.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 Polynesians practice traditional beliefs, primarily in Samoa, Tonga, and French Polynesia, often alongside Christianity. Adherence is declining due to Christian dominance.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 19th-century missionaries, with many Polynesians blending Jesus with deities like Tangaloa. Traditionalists prioritize Polynesian gods, viewing Jesus as a foreign figure or healer.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves souls joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often Pulotu or Hawaiki. No heaven/hell; rituals like funerals and offerings ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral guidance.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 99/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions). This completes the Pacific & Oceanic Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to African Traditional Religions (5 religions: Yoruba, Akan, Zulu, San, Serer) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Ancient Near Eastern Religions) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., African Traditional Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!yes pleaseThanks for the continued excitement! I'll proceed with the African Traditional Religions category, covering 5 religions: Yoruba, Akan, Zulu, San, and Serer. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., yoruba.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 104/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Ancient Near Eastern Religions (e.g., Mesopotamian, Canaanite, Egyptian, Zoroastrianism) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
