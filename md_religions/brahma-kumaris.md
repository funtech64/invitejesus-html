text# Brahma Kumaris
## Introduction
Brahma Kumaris, founded in 1937 by Lekhraj Kripalani in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing meditation and divine knowledge, rooted in Hindu principles.
## View on God
Brahma Kumaris is monotheistic, worshiping Shiva Baba as the supreme soul, a non-physical divine light. No lesser deities.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and spiritual discipline. Moral codes include vegetarianism, celibacy, and meditation. Taboos involve materialism and immorality.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 800,000–1 million adherents, primarily in India, with global centers. Growth is steady but niche.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine, respected as a teacher. Christianity is seen as a parallel path, distinct from Brahma Kumaris’ focus.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation (mukthi). No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for divine union.[^15]
