text# Hellenism (Greek Revival)
## Introduction
Hellenism, or Hellenic Polytheism, is a modern revival of ancient Greek religion, emerging in the late 20th century. It honors the Olympian gods and emphasizes ritual, philosophy, and connection to Greek heritage.
## View on God
Hellenism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, seen as distinct but interconnected beings governing nature and human affairs. The divine is immanent, with no single supreme deity.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics draw from Greek philosophy, emphasizing virtue (arete), moderation, and justice. Moral codes promote respect for the gods, community, and self-improvement. Rituals like offerings reinforce ethical living, with taboos against hubris.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 2,000â€“10,000 adherents, primarily in Greece, the US, and Europe. Growth is slow due to its niche appeal and cultural focus.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Hellenism rejects Christianity, which replaced Greek paganism historically. Jesus is viewed as a historical figure or myth, not divine, with no role in Hellenic theology. Some Hellenists respect his ethics but prioritize Greek gods.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves Hades, a neutral underworld where souls reside. Some believe in reincarnation or the Elysian Fields for the virtuous. No heaven/hell; rituals like libations honor the dead and ensure spiritual peace.[^39][^40]
