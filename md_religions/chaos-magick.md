text# Chaos Magick
## Introduction
Chaos Magick is a modern occult practice, emerging in the 1970s in the UK, emphasizing pragmatic magic and belief as tools for personal transformation. It is non-dogmatic, drawing from various traditions without fixed theology.
## View on God
Chaos Magick is agnostic or non-theistic, viewing "gods" as psychological archetypes or energy constructs, not literal deities. Practitioners may use deities (e.g., from Norse, Egyptian, or fictional pantheons) as symbolic tools for magic, with no commitment to a supreme being.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are individualistic, guided by personal intent and results. Moral codes vary, but most emphasize responsibility for one’s actions and respect for others’ autonomy. The principle "Nothing is true, everything is permitted" encourages flexibility, with taboos against dogmatism.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–30,000 practitioners, primarily in the US, UK, and Europe, often within occult or New Age communities. Growth is steady but niche due to its eclectic nature.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Chaos Magick rejects organized religion, including Christianity, as dogmatic. Jesus may be used as a symbolic archetype in rituals (e.g., for compassion) but is not considered divine. No significant engagement with Christian theology exists.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
Afterlife beliefs are flexible, often involving reincarnation, astral planes, or dissolution into cosmic energy. Practitioners may adopt beliefs temporarily for rituals, with no fixed heaven/hell. Magic practices like sigils prepare the psyche for post-death continuity or transformation.[^29][^30]
