## Introduction

## View on God
Zulu religion is monotheistic, worshiping Unkulunkulu, with ancestors as spiritual intermediaries.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and respect. Moral codes include ancestor veneration and offerings. Taboos involve disrespect.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 10â€“12 million followers, primarily in South Africa. Growth is tied to Zulu population.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as an ancestor or prophet. Christianity is widely integrated.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals ensure spiritual unity.[^10]
