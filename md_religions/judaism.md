text# Judaism
## Introduction
Judaism is one of the oldest monotheistic religions, originating over 3,000 years ago with the Israelites. Based on the Torah and Talmud, it emphasizes covenant with God, ethical living, and cultural identity through diverse traditions (e.g., Orthodox, Reform).
## View on God
Judaism is strictly monotheistic, worshiping YHWH (Yahweh), the one, transcendent creator. God is eternal, omnipotent, and personal, with no intermediaries or Trinity. Jewish theology rejects anthropomorphism.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are rooted in the Torah’s commandments (mitzvot), emphasizing justice, charity (tzedakah), and holiness. Moral codes include Sabbath observance, honesty, and compassion. Taboos include idolatry and harming others.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 14–15 million adherents (0.2% of global population), primarily in Israel, the US, and Europe. Stable, with growth limited by low birth rates and assimilation.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Judaism predates Christianity and rejects Jesus as the Messiah or divine, viewing him as a historical figure or teacher. Christianity is seen as a divergent religion, with historical tensions due to theological differences and past persecution.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is less emphasized than earthly life. Traditional views include Olam Ha-Ba (World to Come), a paradise for the righteous, and Gehenna, a temporary purgatory for the wicked. Some believe in resurrection during the Messianic Age; others focus on spiritual legacy. Rituals like Kaddish honor the dead.[^59][^60]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 81/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions). This completes the Major Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Secular & Philosophical Movements (7 religions: Humanism, Secular Humanism, Atheism, Agnosticism, Deism, Pantheism, Objectivism) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Indigenous American Religions) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 6 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Secular & Philosophical Movements) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Please doThanks for the enthusiasm! I'll proceed with the Secular & Philosophical Movements category, covering 7 religions/movements: Humanism, Secular Humanism, Atheism, Agnosticism, Deism, Pantheism, and Objectivism. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per movement, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., humanism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Philosophical stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 88/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Indigenous American Religions (e.g., Navajo, Lakota, Cherokee, Andean) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., more afterlife focus). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
