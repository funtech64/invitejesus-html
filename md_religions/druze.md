text# Druze
## Introduction
The Druze faith is a monotheistic religion that emerged in the 11th century CE in the Middle East, blending Islamic, Gnostic, and Neoplatonic elements. Founded by Hamza ibn Ali, it is practiced by the Druze community, primarily in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel.
## View on God
The Druze are strictly monotheistic, worshiping Al-Hakim (God), the ultimate, transcendent creator. God is unknowable except through esoteric teachings accessible to religious initiates (uqqal). No intermediaries or lesser deities exist; the faith emphasizes divine unity.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize truthfulness, loyalty to the Druze community, and spiritual discipline. Moral codes, derived from sacred texts like the Epistles of Wisdom, promote virtues like humility and charity. Taboos include lying and abandoning the faith.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 800,000–1,000,000 adherents, primarily in Lebanon (~250,000), Syria (~600,000), and Israel (~150,000), with smaller diaspora communities (US, Canada). Stable but closed to converts, maintaining ethnic cohesion.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Druze respect Jesus as a prophet, as in Islam, but he is not central to their theology. Their esoteric teachings focus on Al-Hakim and earlier prophets like Jethro (Shu‘ayb). Historical coexistence with Christians in the Levant led to mutual respect but no syncretism, as Druze theology is distinct.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The Druze believe in immediate reincarnation, where the soul is reborn into another Druze body at death. There is no heaven or hell; the cycle continues until spiritual perfection is achieved, known only to initiates. Good deeds influence the quality of the next life, with rituals focusing on spiritual growth rather than afterlife preparation.[^49][^50]
