text# Lingayatism
## Introduction
Lingayatism, or Veerashaivism, is a 12th-century Hindu reform movement from Karnataka, India, founded by Basava. It emphasizes monotheistic devotion to Shiva, rejects caste, and promotes personal spirituality over ritualistic Hinduism.
## View on God
Lingayatism is monotheistic, worshiping Shiva as the supreme God, represented by the linga (aniconic symbol). No other deities are central, and Shiva is seen as the eternal, omnipotent creator accessible through personal devotion (ishta linga).[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on equality, nonviolence, and devotion. The five codes (panchaachara) include worship, work, charity, truthfulness, and nonviolence. Lingayats reject caste and ritual purity, emphasizing karma yoga (selfless action) and community service.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 8â€“10 million adherents, primarily in Karnataka, India, with smaller communities in Maharashtra and Telangana. Stable, with some growth through cultural identity movements.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Lingayatism has limited engagement with Christianity, as its theology is rooted in Shaivism. Jesus is not referenced in Lingayat texts, but some modern Lingayats view him as a moral exemplar akin to Basava for his teachings on equality. Historical interactions with Christian missionaries were minimal.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
Lingayatism believes in reincarnation driven by karma, with the soul cycling through births until uniting with Shiva (aikya). There is no eternal heaven or hell; liberation is achieved through devotion and ethical living. Rituals like wearing the ishta linga and meditation prepare the soul for unity with the divine.[^29][^30]
