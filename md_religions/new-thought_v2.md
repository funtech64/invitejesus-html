text# New Thought
## Introduction
New Thought, emerging in the 19th century in the US, is a spiritual movement emphasizing mind power, positive thinking, and divine unity.
## View on God
New Thought is pantheistic, viewing God as infinite intelligence within all. No personal deity is central.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on positive thinking and growth. Moral codes include affirmation, love, and compassion. Taboos involve negativity.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is modest.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, embodying divine mind. Christianity is reinterpreted metaphysically.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual continuity. No heaven/hell; affirmations prepare the soul.[^30]
