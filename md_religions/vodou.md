text# Vodou
## Introduction
Vodou (Voodoo) is a syncretic religion originating in Haiti during the 18th century, blending West African (Dahomey) spiritual traditions with Catholicism. It emphasizes spirits (lwa), rituals, and community healing.
## View on God
Vodou is monotheistic with polytheistic elements, worshiping Bondye as the supreme, distant creator. Lwa (e.g., Papa Legba, Erzulie) are intermediary spirits, syncretized with Catholic saints, guiding human affairs.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community harmony, respect for lwa, and spiritual balance. Moral codes emphasize reciprocity, healing, and ritual observance, with possession ceremonies guiding ethical behavior. Taboos include disrespecting lwa or harming community members.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 2–5 million adherents, primarily in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and diaspora communities (US, Canada). Growth is stable, though limited by stigma and Christian dominance.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Vodou integrates Catholicism, with Jesus often equated with lwa like Damballah (creation) or revered as a divine figure. Practitioners attend Catholic services, blending Christian prayers with lwa worship. Jesus is respected but not central to Vodou’s cosmology.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors or lwa in a spiritual realm, often Ginen. Reincarnation is possible; no heaven/hell. Rituals like funerals and lwa offerings ensure peaceful transitions and spiritual guidance.[^19][^20]
