text# Tenrikyo
## Introduction
Tenrikyo is a Japanese new religion founded in 1838 by Nakayama Miki, emphasizing joy, charity, and devotion to a creator God. Rooted in Shinto and Buddhist influences, it seeks a "Joyous Life" for all humanity through spiritual and communal practices.
## View on God
Tenrikyo is monotheistic, worshiping Oyagami (God the Parent), also called Tenri-O-no-Mikoto, the creator of the universe and humanity. Oyagami is benevolent, guiding humans toward joy through divine providence, with no lesser deities central to worship.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on the "Joyous Life," emphasizing sincerity, gratitude, and mutual help. Moral codes include avoiding selfishness, greed, and arrogance, with practices like hinokishin (voluntary service) promoting community welfare. Taboos involve disrupting harmony or neglecting divine will.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million adherents, primarily in Japan (Nara prefecture), with small communities in the US, Brazil, and South Korea. Growth is modest, limited by its Japanese cultural focus.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Tenrikyo has minimal direct engagement with Christianity, though some members view Jesus as a moral teacher or divine figure akin to Miki’s prophetic role. Christian missionary activity in 19th-century Japan had little impact, and Tenrikyo remains distinct, rooted in Shinto cosmology.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
Tenrikyo emphasizes reincarnation, with souls returning to improve the world toward the Joyous Life. There is no heaven or hell; the afterlife is a continuation of spiritual growth, guided by Oyagami. Rituals like the Kagura service prepare the soul for rebirth and divine harmony.[^19][^20]
