text# Paliau
## Introduction
The Paliau movement, a cargo cult on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, emerged in the 1940s under Paliau Maloat’s leadership. It emphasizes social reform, prosperity, and cargo (Western goods) through rituals and community organization. Reflecting anti-colonial resistance, it blends indigenous beliefs with Christian elements, persisting as a cultural and spiritual force in Melanesia, with ceremonies like communal feasts maintaining its legacy.
## View on God
Paliau is monotheistic, viewing Paliau as a divine or messianic figure tied to social change and abundance.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community reform and equality. Moral codes include solidarity, rituals, and sharing. Taboos involve colonial ways or division.
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 followers, primarily in Papua New Guinea. Growth is limited due to its localized nature.[^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a spirit, often linked to Paliau’s messianic role. Christianity is partially integrated.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms, with Paliau’s teachings promising prosperity. No heaven or hell; rituals prepare the soul.
