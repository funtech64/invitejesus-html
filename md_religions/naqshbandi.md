text# Naqshbandi
## Introduction
The Naqshbandi Order, founded in the 14th century by Baha-ud-Din Naqshband in Central Asia, is a Sufi order emphasizing silent dhikr and spiritual discipline within Sunni Islam.
## View on God
Naqshbandi is monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the sole God, per Islamic theology. Divinity is accessed through mystical practices.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual purity and devotion. Moral codes include dhikr (remembrance), humility, and charity. Taboos involve pride and disobedience.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 10â€“20 million followers, primarily in Central Asia, Turkey, and South Asia. Growth is steady within Islam.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a prophet, not divine, per Islamic belief. Christianity is respected as a monotheistic faith.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic beliefs: paradise or hell based on deeds. Dhikr prepares the soul.[^5]
