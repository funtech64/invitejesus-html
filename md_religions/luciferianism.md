text# Luciferianism
## Introduction
Luciferianism is a modern esoteric movement, emerging in the 20th century, viewing Lucifer as a symbol of enlightenment, knowledge, and rebellion against dogma. It emphasizes individualism and spiritual self-discovery, distinct from Satanism.
## View on God
Luciferianism is non-theistic or theistic, with Lucifer as a symbolic or divine figure of wisdom, not evil. Some see a pantheistic divine force; others worship Lucifer as a spiritual entity. No unified view of a supreme God exists.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-improvement, critical thinking, and personal freedom. Moral codes emphasize knowledge, compassion, and autonomy, with taboos against ignorance and oppression. Practices like meditation foster ethical growth.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“20,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and online communities. Growth is limited due to its niche and controversial nature.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Luciferianism rejects Christian theology, viewing it as dogmatic. Jesus is seen as a historical or symbolic figure, sometimes a teacher of compassion, but not divine. Lucifer is prioritized as a liberator, contrasting with Christian narratives.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
Afterlife beliefs vary, often involving reincarnation or spiritual evolution. Some see Lucifer guiding souls to enlightenment; others deny an afterlife, focusing on earthly growth. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul for self-realization.[^49][^50]
