text# Religious Science
## Introduction
Religious Science, founded in 1927 by Ernest Holmes in the US, is a New Thought movement emphasizing positive thinking and spiritual laws for personal growth.
## View on God
Religious Science is monistic, viewing God as universal mind or spirit within all. No personal deity is central.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on positive thinking and harmony. Moral codes include affirmation, love, and self-discovery. Taboos involve negativity and fear.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000â€“50,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is modest, tied to New Thought.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected within a universal framework.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; affirmations prepare the soul.[^20]
