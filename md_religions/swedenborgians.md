text# Swedenborgians
## Introduction
Swedenborgianism, or the New Church, is a Christian movement founded in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg in Sweden. It emphasizes mystical interpretations of the Bible and spiritual insights from Swedenborg’s visions.
## View on God
Swedenborgians are monotheistic, worshiping God as a single divine being, with Jesus as the visible manifestation of God. The Trinity is one essence, not three persons, with God as Divine Love and Wisdom.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, wisdom, and service. Moral codes emphasize charity, truth, and spiritual growth, with practices like prayer fostering divine alignment. Taboos include selfishness and rejecting spiritual truths.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe (Sweden, UK), and Africa. Declining due to its esoteric nature and small institutional presence.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Swedenborgians identify as Christian, viewing Jesus as God incarnate, whose life reveals divine truths. Swedenborg’s writings reinterpret the Bible, distinguishing the faith from mainstream Christianity, which views it as unorthodox.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves immediate spiritual judgment, with souls entering heaven (a state of love and wisdom) or hell (selfishness) based on their earthly choices. No eternal punishment; souls can progress. Spiritual practices prepare believers for heaven’s communities.[^49][^50]
