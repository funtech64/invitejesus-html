text# Anthroposophy
## Introduction
Anthroposophy is a spiritual philosophy founded in 1913 by Rudolf Steiner in Europe, blending Theosophy, Christianity, and esoteric thought. It emphasizes spiritual science, personal development, and holistic education (e.g., Waldorf schools).
## View on God
Anthroposophy is monistic, viewing the divine as a universal spiritual force permeating existence. Christ is a central cosmic being, not a personal God, guiding humanity’s evolution. No traditional deities are worshipped.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on freedom, compassion, and spiritual growth. Moral codes emphasize individual responsibility, creativity, and service, with practices like meditation and eurythmy fostering ethical living. Taboos include materialism and spiritual stagnation.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in Europe (Germany, Switzerland), the US, and through Waldorf schools globally. Growth is stable, tied to educational and cultural initiatives.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Anthroposophy reinterprets Christianity, viewing Jesus as a human vessel for the Christ Being, a cosmic entity guiding spiritual evolution. It diverges from orthodox Christianity, emphasizing esoteric Christology over traditional salvation narratives.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
Anthroposophy believes in reincarnation and karma, with the soul cycling through lives to evolve spiritually. After death, the soul enters spiritual realms (e.g., Kamaloka, Devachan) for purification and reflection before rebirth. No eternal heaven/hell; practices like meditation prepare the soul for higher evolution.[^29][^30]
