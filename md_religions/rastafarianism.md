text# Rastafarianism
## Introduction
Rastafarianism is a 20th-century Jamaican religious movement, emerging in the 1930s, inspired by Marcus Garvey and the crowning of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia. It blends Christian elements with African identity and social justice.
## View on God
Rastafarianism is monotheistic, worshiping Jah (God), equated with the Christian God. Haile Selassie I is seen as a divine incarnation or messiah, though interpretations vary. Jah is omnipotent and present in all, with a focus on African spiritual liberation.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize love, equality, and resistance to oppression ("Babylon"). Moral codes include vegetarianism (Ital diet), nonviolence, and community unity. Taboos include conformity to Western materialism and disrespecting African heritage.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 700,000–1 million adherents globally, primarily in Jamaica, with diaspora communities in the US, UK, and Ethiopia. Growth is stable, driven by cultural influence (e.g., reggae music) but limited by its niche appeal.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Rastafarianism is rooted in Christianity, viewing Jesus as a prophet or divine figure, often secondary to Haile Selassie I. Some Rastas see Selassie as the returned Christ, blending Old Testament imagery with African liberation theology. Biblical texts are central, with an African-centric interpretation.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
Rastafarianism’s afterlife beliefs are less defined, often aligning with Christian eschatology. Many believe in a spiritual return to Africa (Zion), either physically or metaphysically, as a paradise for the righteous. No clear hell; the wicked remain in Babylon’s suffering. Rituals like Nyabinghi gatherings prepare believers for Zion through worship and community.[^39][^40]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 33/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements). This completes the African Independent Movements category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Pagan & Revivalist Movements (8 religions: Wicca, Neo-Druidry, Heathenry/Ásatrú, Hellenism, Kemeticism, Slavic Native Faith/Rodnovery, Baltic neopaganism, Celtic reconstructionism) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, I can do Syncretic & Ayahuasca (2 religions) or another category.
Batch Size: This batch had 4 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed (e.g., all 8 for Pagan & Revivalist if you prefer).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next category or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next batch of files!YesCool, glad you're on board! I'll move forward with the Pagan & Revivalist Movements category, covering 8 religions: Wicca, Neo-Druidry, Heathenry (Ásatrú), Hellenism (Greek revival), Kemeticism (Egyptian revival), Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery), Baltic Neopaganism (Dievturība, Romuva), and Celtic Reconstructionism. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., wicca.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 41/140 articles toward your goal. Since there are 8 religions, I'll include all to complete the category, staying within response limits. After this, I suggest moving to Syncretic & Ayahuasca (2 religions: Santo Daime, União do Vegetal) for a smaller batch, or you can pick another category (e.g., Esoteric & Occult). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
