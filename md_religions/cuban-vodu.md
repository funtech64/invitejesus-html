text# Cuban Vodú
## Introduction
Cuban Vodú, developed in Cuba among African descendants, is a syncretic religion blending West African Vodun with Catholicism, focusing on spirits and rituals.
## View on God
Cuban Vodú is monotheistic, worshiping Bondye as the supreme creator, with lwa as intermediaries.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and harmony. Moral codes include respect, offerings, and rituals. Taboos involve disrespecting lwa.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000–1 million followers, primarily in Cuba and the diaspora. Growth is modest.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a lwa or divine figure. Christianity is integrated.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^10]
