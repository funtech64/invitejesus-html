text# Chinese Folk Religion
## Introduction
Chinese Folk Religion, a syncretic tradition in China, blends Taoism, Confucianism, and ancestor worship, emphasizing harmony with nature and spirits. Practiced in homes and temples, it involves offerings, festivals like Qingming, and rituals for prosperity. It has shaped Chinese culture, from family values to architecture, and persists despite modernization.
## History
Rooted in ancient Chinese animism, it evolved with Taoism and Confucianism. Dynasties like the Han formalized ancestor worship. Modern suppression under communism gave way to revival. It influences diaspora communities globally.
## View on God
Chinese Folk Religion is polytheistic, venerating deities like the Jade Emperor and local spirits. Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and filial piety. Moral codes include respect, reciprocity, and ritual propriety. Taboos involve disrespecting ancestors.
## Practices
Practices include ancestor worship, offerings, and festivals like the Lunar New Year. Feng shui and divination are common.
## Key Texts
No central text; Taoist and Confucian classics like the *Tao Te Ching* guide practice.
## Demographics
Approximately 400â€“500 million followers (6%), primarily in China and diaspora. Growth is tied to cultural revival.[^21]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a foreign figure, rarely integrated. Christianity is distinct but coexists in some communities.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals honor ancestors for spiritual harmony.
