text# Thelema
## Introduction
Thelema, founded in 1904 by Aleister Crowley in the UK, is a spiritual philosophy emphasizing individual will and esoteric practices based on *The Book of the Law*.
## View on God
Thelema is pantheistic, viewing divinity as universal energy. No personal God; deities are symbolic.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on "Do what thou wilt." Moral codes emphasize personal freedom and responsibility. Taboos involve restriction.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a symbolic figure, not divine. Christianity is critiqued for dogmatism.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^15]
