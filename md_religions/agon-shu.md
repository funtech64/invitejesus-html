text# Agon Shu
## Introduction
Agon Shu, founded in 1978 by Seiyu Kiriyama in Japan, is a Buddhist-derived religion emphasizing esoteric rituals and the Agama sutras for spiritual liberation.
## View on God
Agon Shu is non-theistic, focusing on Buddha-nature rather than a personal God. Spiritual forces guide practitioners.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion and spiritual discipline. Moral codes include meditation, charity, and ritual observance. Taboos involve harm and egoism.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000â€“500,000 followers, primarily in Japan. Growth is limited by its niche focus.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a moral teacher, not divine, with minimal engagement. Christianity is respected but secondary to Buddhist teachings.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until Nirvana. No heaven/hell; rituals like fire ceremonies prepare the soul.[^15]
