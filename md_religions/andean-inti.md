text# Andean Inti
## Introduction
Andean Inti worship, practiced by Andean peoples in Peru and Bolivia, is a traditional faith centered on Inti (sun god) and cosmic balance.
## View on God
Inti worship is polytheistic, venerating Inti as the sun god alongside other deities like Viracocha.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on reciprocity and harmony. Moral codes include offerings, community, and respect. Taboos involve imbalance.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million followers, primarily in Peru and Bolivia. Growth is tied to Andean communities.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized with Inti or Viracocha. Christianity is widely integrated.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms. No heaven/hell; rituals ensure cosmic harmony.[^25]
