## Introduction
The Yoruba religion, originating among the Yoruba people in Nigeria, is a traditional African faith emphasizing worship of Orishas (deities) and ancestral spirits.
## View on God
Yoruba is polytheistic, worshiping Olodumare as the supreme creator alongside Orishas like Orunmila and Shango. Divinity is immanent.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect, sacrifice, and divination. Taboos involve disrespecting Orishas or ancestors.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 10â€“20 million followers, primarily in Nigeria and Benin. Growth is steady, with diaspora influence.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a foreign figure, sometimes syncretized as an Orisha. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^5]
