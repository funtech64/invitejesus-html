text# Agnosticism
## Introduction
Agnosticism is a philosophical stance, formalized in the 19th century by Thomas Huxley, asserting that the existence of God or deities is unknown or unknowable. It emphasizes skepticism and open inquiry.
## View on God
Agnosticism is neutral, neither affirming nor denying God’s existence due to lack of evidence. It avoids commitment to theistic or atheistic claims, focusing on uncertainty and human limits of knowledge.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on human reason and empathy, independent of divine authority. Moral codes promote fairness, compassion, and critical thinking, with taboos against dogmatism and harm.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 300–500 million people globally identify as agnostic, primarily in Europe, the US, and East Asia, often overlapping with secular populations. Growth is tied to secularization.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Agnosticism is neutral toward Christianity, viewing Jesus as a historical figure whose divinity is unproven. Some agnostics respect Jesus’ ethical teachings but remain skeptical of Christian claims.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
Agnosticism takes no firm stance on the afterlife, viewing it as unknowable. Some lean toward no afterlife, focusing on earthly meaning; others remain open to possibilities like reincarnation or spiritual realms, without commitment. No rituals address the afterlife.[^39][^40]
