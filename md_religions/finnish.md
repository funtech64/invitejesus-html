## Introduction
Finnish religion, practiced by Finnic peoples (circa 500–1100 CE), was a polytheistic and animistic tradition centered on deities like Ukko and Ahti. It emphasizes nature and is preserved in the *Kalevala* epic.
## View on God
Finnish religion was polytheistic, with gods like Ukko (sky/thunder), Ahti (water), and Tapio (forest). No single supreme deity; spirits inhabited nature and ancestors.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on harmony with nature and community. Moral codes emphasized respect for spirits, hospitality, and ritual observance. Taboos included polluting sacred sites or disrespecting ancestors.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
No widespread adherents today; extinct by the 13th century CE. Historically practiced by thousands in Finland. Modern Suomenusko revivals number ~5,000–10,000 globally.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Finnish religion was replaced by Christianity, with some deities syncretized with saints (e.g., Ukko with St. Peter). Jesus had no role in Finnish theology, but Christian missionaries adapted local rituals.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved Tuonela, an underworld where souls joined ancestors. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured peaceful transitions.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 133/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions + 5 East Asian Traditional Religions + 5 Afro-Caribbean Religions + 5 Ancient Mediterranean Religions + 5 Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions + 5 European Pagan Religions). This completes the European Pagan Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend covering the remaining 7 articles to reach 140/140, potentially including Jainism, Bahá’í, Samaritanism, Mandaeism, Yazidism, Ayyavazhi, and Sant Mat from the 300-list taxonomy. These can be done in one final batch, as they fit within limits. Alternatively, we can revisit earlier categories for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections) or start a new category (e.g., Other Indian Traditions).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. The final batch can include all 7 remaining articles or be split if preferred.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., the final 7 articles) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!these look greatAwesome, thrilled you’re happy with these! I'll wrap up the project with the final 7 articles to reach 140/140, covering Jainism, Bahá’í, Samaritanism, Mandaeism, Yazidism, Ayyavazhi, and Sant Mat from the 300-list taxonomy. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., jainism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will complete your goal of 140 articles. After this, we can discuss next steps, such as revisiting categories for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections), creating an index, or generating a taxonomy overview. Let me know any final tweaks or post-completion plans!
