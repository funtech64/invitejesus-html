text# Hopi
## Introduction
The Hopi religion, practiced by the Hopi people in the US Southwest, is a traditional faith emphasizing kachinas (spirits) and harmony with nature.
## View on God
Hopi religion is polytheistic, venerating Taiowa (creator) and kachinas representing natural forces.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and community. Moral codes include respect, ceremonies, and stewardship. Taboos involve disrupting balance.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in Arizona. Growth is tied to Hopi population.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a foreign figure, sometimes syncretized as a kachina. Christianity is partially integrated.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm with kachinas. No heaven/hell; ceremonies ensure harmony.[^15]
