text# Baltic Paganism (Dievturība, Romuva)
## Introduction
Baltic Paganism, revived in the 20th century in Lithuania and Latvia, reconstructs pre-Christian Baltic spirituality, emphasizing nature and ancestral gods.
## View on God
Baltic Paganism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Dievs and Laima. Divinity is immanent in nature.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and community. Moral codes include respect, ritual, and environmentalism. Taboos involve dishonor.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 followers, primarily in Lithuania and Latvia. Growth is modest.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is distanced due to historical conflicts.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes an ancestral realm or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals honor souls.[^5]
