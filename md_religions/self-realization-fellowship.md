text# Self-Realization Fellowship
## Introduction
Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF), founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda in the US, is a spiritual movement rooted in Kriya Yoga, emphasizing meditation and divine communion.
## View on God
SRF is monistic, viewing God as universal consciousness (Brahman), accessible through meditation. No personal deity is central.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual discipline and compassion. Moral codes include meditation, nonviolence, and truthfulness. Taboos involve materialism and egoism.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in the US, India, and Europe. Growth is modest, tied to yoga’s popularity.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is revered as a realized master, equal to yogis like Krishna. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted mystically.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation (moksha). No heaven/hell; Kriya Yoga prepares the soul for divine unity.[^5]
