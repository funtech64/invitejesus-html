text# Niâ€™matullahi
## Introduction
The Niâ€™matullahi Order, founded in the 14th century by Shah Niâ€™matullah Wali in Iran, is a Sufi order emphasizing spiritual love and service within Shia Islam.
## View on God
Niâ€™matullahi is monotheistic, worshiping Allah. Mystical practices connect to divine love.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion and devotion. Moral codes include dhikr and charity. Taboos involve pride.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000â€“1 million followers, primarily in Iran and South Asia. Growth is modest.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a prophet, not divine, per Islamic belief. Christianity is respected.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic beliefs: paradise or hell. Sufi practices prepare the soul.[^30]
