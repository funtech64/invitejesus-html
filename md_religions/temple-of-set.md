text# Temple of Set
## Introduction
The Temple of Set, founded in 1975 by Michael Aquino in the US, is a new religious movement derived from the Church of Satan, emphasizing self-deification and Setian philosophy.
## View on God
The Temple is henotheistic, worshiping Set as the principle of consciousness and isolation. Other deities are symbolic.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-realization and Xeper (becoming). Moral codes include knowledge and responsibility. Taboos involve stagnation and weakness.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000â€“5,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its initiatory structure.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is rejected as limiting.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual immortality or evolution. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^15]
