text# Self-Realization Fellowship
## Introduction
Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF), founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda in the US, is a spiritual movement blending Hindu yoga with universal spirituality. Centered on Kriya Yoga, it teaches meditation to realize God within. SRF’s *Autobiography of a Yogi* popularized its teachings, with centers offering retreats and study groups worldwide. It emphasizes unity across religions, appealing to spiritual seekers in the West and India.
## View on God
SRF is monistic, viewing God as the universal consciousness within all, accessible through meditation.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-realization and harmony. Moral codes include nonviolence, truth, and meditation. Taboos involve egoism and materialism, blocking spiritual growth.
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in the US and India. Growth is steady through yoga centers.[^21]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a divine avatar, equal to Krishna. Christianity is respected as a path to the same universal truth.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or liberation. No heaven or hell; Kriya Yoga prepares the soul for divine union.
