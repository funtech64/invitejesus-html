## Introduction
Buddhism, founded in the 5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in India, is a non-theistic religion emphasizing enlightenment through the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path. Branches like Theravāda, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna vary in practice. Buddhists meditate and worship at stupas or temples, influencing art, philosophy, and ethics across Asia and beyond.
## History
The Buddha’s teachings spread from India to Southeast Asia and China. Theravāda became dominant in Sri Lanka, Mahāyāna in East Asia, and Vajrayāna in Tibet. Colonialism and globalization spread Buddhism to the West. Modern movements like Soka Gakkai continue its growth.
## View on God
Buddhism is non-theistic, rejecting a creator god. Enlightenment is achieved through self-realization, with deities as symbolic in some traditions.
## View on Ethics
Ethics follow the Eightfold Path, emphasizing right action, speech, and mindfulness. Moral codes include nonviolence and compassion. Taboos involve harming life.
## Practices
Meditation, chanting, and offerings are central. Practices vary by branch, from Zen meditation to Tibetan rituals.
## Key Texts
The Pali Canon, Mahāyāna sutras (e.g., Lotus Sutra), and Tibetan texts guide practice.
## Demographics
Approximately 520 million followers (6%), primarily in Asia. Growth is strong in the West.[^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a wise teacher in some Buddhist views. Christianity is respected but distinct due to theistic differences.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation based on karma, aiming for nirvana. No eternal heaven or hell; meditation aids liberation.
