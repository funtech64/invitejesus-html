## Introduction
Hawaiian religion, the traditional spiritual system of Native Hawaiians, centers on gods like Kāne (creator) and Pele (volcano goddess), emphasizing harmony with nature and ancestral spirits. Rooted in Polynesian traditions, it involves rituals at *heiau* (temples), hula dances, and offerings to maintain *mana* (spiritual power). Suppressed by 19th-century missionaries, it persists through cultural revival in practices like lei-making and chants, often blended with Christianity. Sacred sites like volcanoes and springs remain central to worship, reflecting a deep connection to the land and sea.
## View on God
Hawaiian religion is polytheistic, venerating gods like Kāne, Lono (fertility), and Kū (war). *Aumakua* (ancestral spirits) guide families, with divinity immanent in nature.
## View on Ethics
Ethics revolve around *pono* (righteousness) and *aloha* (love). Moral codes include respect for nature, community, and rituals. Taboos (*kapu*) involve violating sacred spaces or disrespecting gods.
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 followers, primarily in Hawaii, with many blending with Christianity. Growth is tied to Native Hawaiian cultural revival efforts.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a healer or spirit, equated with figures like Lono. Christianity, introduced by missionaries, is widely integrated, with Hawaiian gods aligned with saints.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves *Po* (underworld) or ancestral realms, with possible reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals like funerals ensure the soul’s peaceful transition and continued guidance.
