text# Bahá’í Faith
## Introduction
The Bahá’í Faith is a monotheistic religion founded in 19th-century Persia by Bahá’u’lláh, emphasizing the unity of God, religion, and humanity. It promotes global peace and equality through spiritual teachings and community organization.
## View on God
The Bahá’í Faith is strictly monotheistic, worshiping one God, eternal and unknowable, who is the creator of all. God manifests through prophets (e.g., Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Bahá’u’lláh), with no intermediaries or lesser deities.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on unity, justice, and service to humanity. Moral codes include honesty, chastity, and equality, with practices like daily prayer and fasting promoting spiritual growth. Taboos include prejudice, backbiting, and harming others.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–8 million adherents globally, primarily in Iran, India, the US, and Africa (e.g., Uganda, Kenya). Growth is steady, driven by its universalist appeal, though limited by persecution in some regions.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Bahá’í Faith recognizes Jesus as a Manifestation of God, equal to other prophets like Muhammad and Bahá’u’lláh. His teachings on love and compassion are revered, but Bahá’ís view Christianity as one of many valid religions, superseded by Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation. The faith integrates Christian ethics but diverges from Trinitarian theology.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul’s eternal journey toward God after death. Souls progress through spiritual realms based on deeds and faith, with no physical heaven or hell. The righteous draw closer to God’s presence, while the wicked face spiritual separation. Practices like prayer and good deeds prepare the soul for eternal growth, with no final judgment or reincarnation.[^9][^10]
