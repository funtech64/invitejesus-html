text# Aladura Churches
## Introduction
Aladura Churches are a group of African Independent Churches founded in Nigeria in the early 20th century, emphasizing prayer (aladura means "prayer" in Yoruba), healing, and Africanized Christianity. Key denominations include the Cherubim and Seraphim and the Celestial Church of Christ.
## View on God
Aladura Churches are monotheistic, worshiping the Christian God as the omnipotent creator, part of the Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). God is accessible through fervent prayer and spiritual gifts like prophecy and healing.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics follow Christian principles, emphasizing faith, love, and moral purity. Moral codes include adherence to the Ten Commandments, charity, and community support, with a focus on African cultural expressions like dance and fasting. Taboos include sin and reliance on traditional rituals over Christian ones.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 3–5 million adherents, primarily in Nigeria (Lagos, Ogun states), with diaspora communities in the UK, US, and West Africa. Growth is strong due to charismatic worship and cultural relevance.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Aladura Churches are explicitly Christian, centering Jesus as the Son of God and savior whose death atones for sins. They emphasize direct spiritual experiences with Jesus through prayer and miracles, integrating African cultural elements like Yoruba music into worship.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Christian theology, with souls judged after death. The righteous enter heaven, a place of eternal joy with God, while the wicked face hell or separation. Aladura’s focus on prayer and healing prepares believers for heaven, with visions and prophecies reinforcing eschatological hope.[^19][^20]
