text# Unity Church
## Introduction
Unity Church, founded in 1889 by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore in the US, is a New Thought movement emphasizing positive thinking, prayer, and spiritual unity.
## View on God
Unity is monotheistic, viewing God as a universal Spirit within all. Not anthropomorphic, God is love and wisdom.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on positive thinking and spiritual growth. Moral codes include love, forgiveness, and mindfulness. Taboos involve negativity and judgment.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 adherents, primarily in the US, with small global communities. Growth is modest.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, embodying the Christ consciousness, not uniquely divine. Unity reinterprets Christianity with metaphysical focus.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution, with souls progressing toward divine unity. No literal heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^10]
