text# Secular/Philosophical
## Introduction
Secular/Philosophical traditions encompass non-religious worldviews like atheism, agnosticism, and humanism, emphasizing reason, ethics, and human potential. Emerging from Enlightenment thought, they reject supernatural beliefs, focusing on science and human agency. Practiced globally in secular societies, they influence education, law, and ethics, offering alternatives to religious frameworks while coexisting with them.
## History
Secularism grew from ancient skepticism and Renaissance humanism. The Enlightenment formalized atheism and agnosticism, with figures like Voltaire shaping modern thought. Today, secular philosophies thrive in Europe and urban areas, driven by science and individualism.
## View on God
Secular traditions are non-theistic, rejecting gods (atheism) or withholding judgment (agnosticism). Humanism focuses on human potential.
## View on Ethics
Ethics derive from reason and empathy. Moral codes emphasize justice, compassion, and human rights. Taboos involve dogma and harm.
## Practices
No rituals; practices include philosophical debate, education, and activism for secular governance.
## Key Texts
No sacred texts; works like Mill’s *Utilitarianism* or Dawkins’ *The God Delusion* guide thought.
## Demographics
Approximately 1.2 billion adherents (16%), primarily in Europe, China, and the US. Growth is strong in developed nations.[^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, valued for ethics but not divine. Christianity is respected but critiqued for faith-based claims.
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife; death is final. Focus is on earthly well-being and legacy.
