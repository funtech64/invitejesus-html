text# Raëlism
## Introduction
Raëlism is a UFO-based religion founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (Raël) in France. It claims humans were created by extraterrestrials (Elohim) and promotes peace, sensuality, and scientific advancement to prepare for their return.
## View on God
Raëlism is atheistic, rejecting a supernatural God. The Elohim, advanced extraterrestrials, are seen as creators of humanity, not divine. Practitioners focus on human potential and scientific progress rather than deity worship.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize love, freedom, and scientific inquiry. Moral codes promote nonviolence, sexual liberation, and global unity, with taboos against aggression and dogmatism. Practices like meditation and sensual living foster ethical growth.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents globally, primarily in France, Canada, Japan, and the US. Growth is limited due to its controversial claims and niche appeal.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Raëlism views Christianity as a misunderstanding of Elohim teachings. Jesus is seen as a human messenger of the Elohim, not divine, with a role similar to Raël’s. The religion rejects Christian theology but incorporates Jesus as a historical figure.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
Raëlism believes in scientific immortality through cloning or consciousness transfer by the Elohim. No spiritual afterlife exists; the righteous may be recreated by the Elohim on another planet, while others cease to exist. Rituals focus on earthly preparation for this technological afterlife.[^39][^40]
