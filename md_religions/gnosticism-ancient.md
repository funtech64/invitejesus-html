text# Gnosticism (Ancient)
## Introduction
Ancient Gnosticism was a collection of religious movements from the 1st–4th centuries CE, blending Jewish, Christian, and Hellenistic ideas. It emphasized esoteric knowledge (gnosis) for salvation, with texts like the Nag Hammadi scriptures.
## View on God
Gnosticism was dualistic, with a supreme, unknowable God (Monad) above a flawed demiurge (often equated with the Old Testament God). Divine emanations (aeons) like Sophia mediated salvation.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on spiritual liberation through gnosis, rejecting materialism. Moral codes emphasized purity, wisdom, and compassion. Taboos included attachment to the material world and ignorance.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 5th century CE. Historically practiced by thousands in the Mediterranean. Modern Gnostic revivals number fewer than 30,000 globally.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Gnosticism engaged deeply with Christianity, viewing Jesus as a divine revealer of gnosis, not merely the Son of God. Texts like the Gospel of Thomas emphasize his teachings over orthodox salvation, causing conflict with mainstream Christianity.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved the soul’s ascent to the Pleroma (divine fullness), escaping the material world. The righteous achieved liberation; the ignorant remained trapped. Rituals like secret initiations prepared the soul for ascent.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 123/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions + 5 East Asian Traditional Religions + 5 Afro-Caribbean Religions + 5 Ancient Mediterranean Religions). This completes the Ancient Mediterranean Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions (5 religions: Maya, Aztec, Olmec, Toltec, Zapotec) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., European Pagan Religions like Norse, Celtic) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!yesThanks for the continued enthusiasm! I'll proceed with the Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions category, covering 5 religions: Maya, Aztec, Olmec, Toltec, and Zapotec. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., maya.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 128/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to European Pagan Religions (e.g., Norse, Celtic, Baltic, Slavic) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
