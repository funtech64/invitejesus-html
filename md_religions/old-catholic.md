## Introduction
Old Catholic Church, emerging in the 19th century in Europe, is a Christian denomination rejecting papal infallibility, emphasizing traditional Catholicism.
## View on God
Old Catholicism is monotheistic, worshiping one God in Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and tradition. Moral codes include charity and sacraments. Taboos involve heresy.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 followers, primarily in Europe. Growth is modest.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is divine, part of the Trinity. Christianity is central, with Catholic roots.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves heaven or hell, with purgatory. Sacraments prepare the soul.[^15]
