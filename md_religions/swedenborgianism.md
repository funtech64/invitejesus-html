text# Swedenborgianism
## Introduction
Swedenborgianism, founded in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg in Sweden, emphasizes mystical Christianity and spiritual insights from Swedenborg’s visions.
## View on God
Swedenborgianism is monotheistic, worshiping one God manifested as a divine human. No Trinity; Jesus is God’s form.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and wisdom. Moral codes include charity, spiritual growth, and truth. Taboos involve selfishness and falsehood.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–20,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited by its esoteric nature.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central, seen as the divine human embodying God. Swedenborgianism aligns with Christianity but reinterprets doctrines.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms where souls choose heaven or hell based on love. Rituals prepare the soul.[^15]
