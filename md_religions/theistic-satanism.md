text# Theistic Satanism
## Introduction
Theistic Satanism is a new religious movement viewing Satan as a literal deity or spiritual entity, emerging in the 20th century, distinct from LaVeyan atheism.
## View on God
Theistic Satanism is monotheistic or henotheistic, worshiping Satan as a divine being of freedom and knowledge. Other deities may be acknowledged.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal power and rebellion. Moral codes include self-empowerment and loyalty to Satan. Taboos involve weakness and conformity.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited by stigma.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an antagonist or irrelevant. Christianity is rejected as oppressive.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a realm with Satan or spiritual immortality. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^10]
