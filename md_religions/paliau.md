## Introduction
The Paliau movement, a cargo cult on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, originating in the 1940s, emphasizes social reform and prosperity, blending indigenous and colonial ideas.
## View on God
Paliau is monotheistic, viewing Paliau as a divine or messianic figure. Divinity is tied to social change.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and reform. Moral codes include equality, rituals, and unity. Taboos involve colonial ways.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000â€“5,000 followers, primarily in Papua New Guinea. Growth is limited.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a spirit. Christianity is integrated.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^20]
