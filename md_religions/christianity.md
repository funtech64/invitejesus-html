## Introduction
Christianity is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion centered on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is the world's largest religion, with diverse denominations sharing core theological elements while varying in interpretation.
## View on God
Christianity affirms monotheism, rejecting polytheism and atheism. God is understood as a single divine being in three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit—the doctrine of the Trinity. Jesus is viewed as fully divine and human, the incarnate Son of God, central to salvation. God is eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, the creator of the universe.[^1][^2]
## View on Afterlife
Believers anticipate an afterlife involving judgment, with the righteous entering heaven (eternal communion with God) and the unrighteous facing hell (separation from God or punishment). Salvation through faith in Jesus' atonement redeems humanity from sin, leading to eternal life. Concepts like purgatory exist in some traditions (e.g., Catholicism).[^1][^3]
## View on Ethics
Christian ethics emphasize love, morality, and redemption. Core principles include the Ten Commandments (e.g., no murder, theft, adultery) and Jesus' teachings like the Golden Rule ("love thy neighbor as thyself") and Sermon on the Mount (e.g., mercy, peacemaking). Ethics focus on aligning with God's will, promoting virtues like humility, charity, and forgiveness, while condemning sin.[^1][^4]
## History
Christianity originated in the 1st century CE in Judea, based on Jesus of Nazareth's ministry (c. 4 BCE–30 CE). Early followers spread the faith despite Roman persecution. Key events include the Council of Nicaea (325 CE, affirming the Trinity), the Great Schism (1054 CE, splitting Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism), and the Protestant Reformation (1517 CE, led by Martin Luther, emphasizing scripture over tradition). Global spread occurred via missions, colonialism, and migrations, reaching over 2 billion adherents today across Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia.[^1][^5]
## Demographics
Approximately 2.4 billion adherents (31% of global population as of 2025), with major concentrations in Europe (Catholic/Orthodox), the Americas (Protestant/Catholic), sub-Saharan Africa (growing Pentecostal/Evangelical), and Asia-Pacific. Subgroups: Catholics ~50%, Protestants ~37%, Orthodox ~12%.[^6]
