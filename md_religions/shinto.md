text# Shinto
## Introduction
Shinto is Japan’s indigenous religion, dating back to ancient times, centered on kami (spirits) and harmony with nature. It emphasizes rituals, shrines, and purification, coexisting with Buddhism in Japan.
## View on God
Shinto is polytheistic and animistic, with countless kami representing nature, ancestors, and concepts (e.g., Amaterasu, sun goddess). No supreme God; kami are immanent in the world.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity, sincerity, and harmony with nature. Moral codes emphasize respect for kami, community, and tradition, with rituals like misogi (purification) reinforcing values. Taboos include pollution (kegare) and disrespecting kami.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 80–100 million Japanese engage with Shinto practices, though formal adherence is ~2–4 million, primarily in Japan. Stable, tied to cultural identity rather than exclusive belief.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Shinto has minimal engagement with Christianity, introduced in the 16th century. Jesus is seen as a foreign figure or kami by some, but not central. Syncretism is rare, with Shinto remaining distinct.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is vague; souls may join kami or ancestors in a spiritual realm (Yomi or Takamagahara). No heaven/hell; the focus is on earthly purity. Rituals like funerals and shrine offerings honor the dead and ensure their peace.[^29][^30]
