text# Eckankar
## Introduction
Eckankar is a new religious movement founded in 1965 by Paul Twitchell in the US, emphasizing soul travel and divine light and sound. It draws from Sant Mat and Western esotericism.
## View on God
Eckankar is monotheistic, worshiping Sugmad, a transcendent God. The Living ECK Master guides followers to divine truth.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual freedom and love. Moral codes include meditation, truth, and nonviolence. Taboos include harming souls or rejecting the ECK.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and Africa. Growth is modest.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Eckankar views Jesus as a spiritual master, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to Eckankar’s teachings.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves soul travel to higher planes or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; meditation on the ECK prepares the soul.[^20]
