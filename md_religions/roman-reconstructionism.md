text# Roman Reconstructionism
## Introduction
Roman Reconstructionism, revived in the 20th century, is a neo-pagan religion reconstructing ancient Roman spirituality, emphasizing worship of gods like Jupiter.
## View on God
Roman Reconstructionism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Jupiter and Juno. Divinity is immanent in nature and society.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on pietas (duty). Moral codes include ritual, loyalty, and justice. Taboos involve disrespect and chaos.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 followers, primarily in Italy and the US. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is distanced due to historical conflicts.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes the Underworld or Elysium. No heaven/hell; rituals ensure spiritual peace.[^30]

Next Batch: I’ll continue with 6 more Neo-Paganism groups from the YAML (e.g., Baltic Paganism, Church of Satan, Theistic Satanism, Temple of Set, Satanic Temple, Temple of the Vampire). Let me know if you prefer a different category (e.g., Sufism, Indigenous) or any tweaks, and I’ll generate the next set!
