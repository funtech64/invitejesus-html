text# Vedanta Society
## Introduction
The Vedanta Society, founded in 1894 by Swami Vivekananda in the US, promotes Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing universal spirituality and self-realization through Hindu philosophy.
## View on God
Vedanta is monistic, viewing God as Brahman, the infinite consciousness. All religions reflect this truth; no personal deity is central.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-realization and service. Moral codes include compassion, truth, and meditation. Taboos involve egoism and harm.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 adherents, primarily in India, the US, and Europe. Growth is modest, tied to intellectual appeal.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual master, equal to other avatars. Christianity is a valid path within Vedanta’s universal framework.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until moksha (liberation). No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for unity with Brahman.[^10]
