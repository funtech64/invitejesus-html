## Introduction
Sekai Kyusei Kyo (World Messianity), founded in 1935 by Mokichi Okada in Japan, is a new religious movement emphasizing healing and paradise on Earth through Johrei.
## View on God
Sekai Kyusei Kyo is monotheistic, worshiping a God of light. Okada is a messianic figure.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and healing. Moral codes include gratitude and service. Taboos involve negativity.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 1 million followers, primarily in Japan and Brazil. Growth is modest.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
