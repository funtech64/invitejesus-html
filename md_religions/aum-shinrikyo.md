text# Aum Shinrikyo
## Introduction
Aum Shinrikyo is a Japanese new religious movement founded in 1984 by Shoko Asahara, blending Buddhism, Hinduism, and apocalyptic beliefs. Known for the 1995 Tokyo sarin attack, it is now diminished but historically significant.
## View on God
Aum Shinrikyo is syncretic, with Shiva (Hindu god) as a central deity, alongside Buddhist and apocalyptic elements. Asahara was seen as a divine figure or enlightened master. The divine is a cosmic force accessible through meditation.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual liberation and obedience to Asahara’s teachings. Moral codes included asceticism and devotion, with taboos against worldly attachments. Controversial practices justified violence for apocalyptic goals.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–2,000 adherents at its peak in Japan; now fewer than 1,000, primarily in Japan and Russia, due to legal bans and stigma post-1995.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Aum Shinrikyo incorporated Christian apocalyptic imagery but viewed Jesus as a minor prophet or enlightened figure, not central. Christianity was seen as part of a broader spiritual narrative, subordinate to Asahara’s teachings.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation and spiritual evolution, with the righteous achieving liberation through Aum’s practices. Asahara’s apocalyptic vision predicted a final battle, with followers ascending to a divine realm. No eternal hell; meditation and rituals prepared the soul.[^49][^50]
