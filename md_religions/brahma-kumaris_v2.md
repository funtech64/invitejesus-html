text# Brahma Kumaris
## Introduction
The Brahma Kumaris, founded in 1937 by Lekhraj Kripalani in India, is a spiritual movement emphasizing meditation and spiritual knowledge to achieve self-realization. Rooted in Hindu philosophy, it teaches that souls are eternal and God is a supreme soul, Shiva. Members, often women-led, practice Raja Yoga meditation and live ascetically, wearing white to symbolize purity. Centers worldwide offer courses on positive thinking and stress-free living. The movement’s apocalyptic worldview anticipates a new golden age, appealing to those seeking inner peace and transformation.
## View on God
Brahma Kumaris is monotheistic, venerating Shiva as the Supreme Soul, a spiritual entity beyond physical form, guiding souls to liberation.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and self-discipline. Moral codes include celibacy, vegetarianism, and meditation. Taboos involve materialism, violence, and egoism, seen as obstacles to spiritual growth.
## Demographics
Approximately 800,000–1 million followers, primarily in India, with global centers in over 100 countries. Growth is steady through outreach.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine, respected for his teachings. Christianity is seen as a valid path but distinct from Brahma Kumaris’ focus on soul-consciousness.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a cycle of reincarnation until liberation (*mukti*). No heaven or hell; meditation purifies the soul for the golden age.
