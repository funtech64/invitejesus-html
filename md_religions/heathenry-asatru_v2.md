text# Heathenry (Ásatrú)
## Introduction
Heathenry (Ásatrú), revived in the 1970s in Iceland, is a neo-pagan religion based on Norse mythology, emphasizing community and ancestral traditions.
## View on God
Ásatrú is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Odin, Thor, and Freyja. Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on honor and community. Moral codes include loyalty, hospitality, and ritual observance. Taboos involve dishonor and disrespect.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 followers, primarily in Iceland, the US, and Europe. Growth is modest, tied to neo-paganism.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often distanced due to historical conflicts with Norse traditions.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes Valhalla, Hel, or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals honor ancestors for spiritual continuity.[^5]
