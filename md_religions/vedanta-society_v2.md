text# Vedanta Society
## Introduction
The Vedanta Society, founded in 1894 by Swami Vivekananda in the US, is a spiritual movement promoting Vedanta philosophy, emphasizing universal spirituality and self-realization. Rooted in Hindu Advaita Vedanta, it teaches that all religions lead to the same truth. Centers offer meditation, lectures, and *puja*, with a focus on interfaith harmony. Vivekananda’s global influence, starting at the 1893 Chicago Parliament, made it a bridge between East and West.
## View on God
The Society is monistic, viewing God as Brahman, the infinite reality underlying all religions and existence.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual unity and service. Moral codes include nonviolence, truth, and charity. Taboos involve intolerance and egoism.
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 followers, primarily in the US and India. Growth is modest through centers.[^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a divine incarnation, equal to other avatars. Christianity is respected as a valid spiritual path.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or liberation (*moksha*). No heaven or hell; meditation prepares the soul for unity with Brahman.

(Africa)ŚvētāmbaraJainismThank you for sharing the Religion_300_list file! 😄 We're at 290/300 unique articles from the YAML taxonomy, with 10 remaining. This batch covers 6 New Religious Movements from the provided list: Transcendental Meditation, Art of Living Foundation, Sathya Sai Baba, Meher Baba, Church of All Worlds, and Aetherius Society. Articles are 200–300 words, in Markdown format for the /religions/ folder, with lowercase, hyphenated slugs. None exceed 2% of the world population (~160 million), so they stay concise. This brings us to 296/300 unique articles. Structure remains consistent: Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, with neutral, academic sources. For major religions (>2%), I’ll expand to 500–750 words in the final batch.
