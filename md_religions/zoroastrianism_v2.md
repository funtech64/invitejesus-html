text# Zoroastrianism
## Introduction
Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion founded by Zoroaster (Zarathustra) in ancient Persia (circa 1500–600 BCE). Based on the Avesta, it emphasizes the struggle between good and evil, influencing Abrahamic religions.
## View on God
Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, worshiping Ahura Mazda as the supreme, all-wise creator. Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the evil spirit, opposes him, creating a dualistic cosmology. Lesser divinities (yazatas) assist Ahura Mazda.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on good thoughts, words, and deeds to support Ahura Mazda’s order (asha). Moral codes emphasize truth, charity, and purity. Taboos include lying, pollution, and aiding evil forces.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 adherents globally, primarily in India (Parsis), Iran, and diaspora communities (US, UK). Declining due to low birth rates and assimilation.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Zoroastrianism influenced Christianity through concepts like heaven/hell and messianic figures. Jesus is seen as a foreign prophet, with no role in Zoroastrian theology. Some parallels exist between Jesus and the Saoshyant (future savior).[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves judgment at the Chinvat Bridge, where the righteous enter paradise (House of Song) and the wicked fall into a temporary hell. A final renewal (Frashokereti) restores all souls. Rituals like fire ceremonies and prayers prepare the soul.[^39][^40]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 108/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions). This completes the Ancient Near Eastern Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to East Asian Traditional Religions (5 religions: Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, Cheondoism, Won Buddhism) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Afro-Caribbean Religions like Santería, Vodou) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 4 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., East Asian Traditional Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!yesThanks for the enthusiasm! I'll proceed with the East Asian Traditional Religions category, covering 5 religions: Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, Cheondoism, and Won Buddhism. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., taoism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 113/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Afro-Caribbean Religions (5 religions: Santería, Vodou, Candomblé, Umbanda, Quimbanda) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
