text# Lakota Sun Dance
## Introduction
The Lakota Sun Dance, practiced by the Lakota people in the US, is a traditional ceremony emphasizing sacrifice, renewal, and spiritual connection.
## View on God
The Sun Dance is monotheistic, worshiping Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit) as the supreme creator, with spirits as intermediaries.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and sacrifice. Moral codes include respect, prayer, and offerings. Taboos involve disrespect.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 participants, primarily in the US (Great Plains). Growth is tied to Lakota population.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm. No heaven/hell; Sun Dance ceremonies prepare the soul.[^30]
