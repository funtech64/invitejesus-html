text# Samaritanism
## Introduction
Samaritanism is an ancient Abrahamic religion practiced by the Samaritans, a small ethnoreligious group in Israel and the West Bank, tracing their origins to the ancient Israelites. It centers on the Torah and Mount Gerizim as the holiest site.
## View on God
Samaritanism is strictly monotheistic, worshiping YHWH (Yahweh), the one true God, as revealed to Moses. No other deities or intermediaries exist, and God is seen as transcendent, eternal, and creator of all.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on the Samaritan Pentateuch (Torah), emphasizing obedience to God’s commandments, similar to Jewish law (e.g., Sabbath, purity laws). Virtues include justice, charity, and community unity. Taboos include idolatry and violating sacred laws.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 800–1,000 adherents, split between Mount Gerizim (West Bank) and Holon (Israel). Numbers are critically low due to historical persecution and intermarriage restrictions.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Samaritans reject Christianity, as their theology is based solely on the Pentateuch, which predates Jesus. Early Christian texts (e.g., John 4) depict Samaritans interacting with Jesus, but Samaritans view him as irrelevant or a false prophet, maintaining their distinct identity separate from Christian or Jewish traditions.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
Samaritanism’s afterlife beliefs are less detailed than in other Abrahamic faiths. The soul faces judgment based on adherence to the Torah, with the righteous rewarded in a paradisiacal state near God, often associated with Mount Gerizim. The wicked face punishment, though details are vague, with no eternal hell. Some texts suggest a resurrection at the Day of Vengeance and Recompense, led by a restorer (Taheb), who is not a messiah like Jesus but a Moses-like figure. Rituals focus on earthly obedience rather than afterlife preparation.[^39][^40]
