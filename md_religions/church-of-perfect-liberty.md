text# Church of Perfect Liberty
## Introduction
The Church of Perfect Liberty, founded in 1924 by Tokumitsu Kanada in Japan, emphasizes self-expression and joy through spiritual teachings and rituals.
## View on God
The Church is monotheistic, worshiping a universal God of life. No lesser deities are central.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on joyful living and creativity. Moral codes include gratitude, service, and self-expression. Taboos involve negativity and suppression.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in Japan and Brazil. Growth is modest.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a moral teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to the Church’s teachings.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals like prayer prepare the soul for joy.[^25]
