text# Builders of the Adytum
## Introduction
Builders of the Adytum (BOTA), founded in 1922 by Paul Foster Case in the US, is an esoteric movement blending Tarot, Kabbalah, and Western mysticism.
## View on God
BOTA is monistic, viewing God as universal consciousness. No personal deity; spiritual forces guide.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-knowledge and spiritual growth. Moral codes include study and meditation. Taboos involve misuse of power.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000â€“5,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a symbolic figure, not divine. Christianity is reinterpreted esoterically.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^20]
