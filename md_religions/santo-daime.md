text# Santo Daime
## Introduction
Santo Daime is a syncretic religion founded in the 1930s by Raimundo Irineu Serra in Brazil’s Amazon region. It blends Christianity, African spiritualism, and indigenous shamanism, centering on the sacramental use of ayahuasca, a psychoactive brew, for spiritual communion and healing.
## View on God
Santo Daime is monotheistic, worshiping the Christian God as the supreme creator, often referred to as the Divine Father or Juramidam. The religion integrates Christian theology with Amazonian spirituality, viewing God as accessible through ayahuasca-induced visions and hymns. Spirits and saints, including indigenous entities, act as intermediaries.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize love, charity, and spiritual growth, rooted in Christian and indigenous values. Moral codes promote community harmony, respect for nature, and humility. The use of ayahuasca is guided by strict ritual protocols, with taboos against misuse or disrespecting the sacrament.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 adherents globally, primarily in Brazil (Acre, Rondônia), with communities in the US, Europe (e.g., Netherlands, Spain), and Japan. Growth is modest, driven by spiritual seekers but limited by legal restrictions on ayahuasca.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Santo Daime is deeply Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God and a central figure of salvation. Hymns and rituals often invoke Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and saints, blending them with Amazonian spirits. The religion sees ayahuasca as a means to commune with Christ’s teachings, integrating Christian prayers with shamanic practices.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Santo Daime believes in a Christian-inspired afterlife with reincarnation elements from Spiritism. After death, the soul faces judgment, with the righteous entering heaven or higher spiritual realms, and the wicked facing purification through rebirth. Ayahuasca ceremonies, guided by hymns, prepare the soul for spiritual evolution, aiming for divine communion. There is no eternal hell; all souls progress toward God through cycles.[^9][^10]
