## Introduction
Ancient Greek religion, practiced from circa 1200 BCE to 300 CE, was a polytheistic tradition centered on the Olympian gods and civic rituals. It profoundly influenced Western culture through its myths, philosophy, and art.
## View on God
Greek religion was polytheistic, with gods like Zeus (sky), Athena (wisdom), and Apollo (sun) governing cosmic and human affairs. No single supreme deity; gods were anthropomorphic, interacting with humans via oracles and myths.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on honoring gods through rituals and maintaining civic order. Moral codes emphasized piety, hospitality (xenia), and justice. Taboos included hubris (excessive pride) and neglecting sacred duties.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 4th century CE. Historically practiced by millions in Greece and the Mediterranean. Modern Hellenic revivals (e.g., Hellenism) number fewer than 20,000 globally.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Greek religion predates Christianity but influenced it through Hellenistic culture (e.g., Neoplatonism, Logos theology). Jesus had no role in Greek theology, though early Christians adopted Greek concepts like the soul and divine intermediaries.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved Hades, a shadowy underworld where souls existed as shades, with little distinction between righteous and wicked. Exceptional souls reached Elysium (paradise) or faced Tartarus (punishment). Rituals like burials and offerings ensured the deadâ€™s comfort.[^9][^10]
