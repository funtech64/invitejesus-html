text# Pacific Islander Traditional Religions
## Introduction
Pacific Islander traditional religions include the diverse spiritual practices of Polynesian, Melanesian, and Micronesian peoples (e.g., Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan). They emphasize gods, ancestors, and nature, expressed through chants, dances, and communal rituals.
## View on God
These religions are polytheistic and animistic, with gods like Kāne (Hawaiian creator), Tagaloa (Samoan sky god), and others governing nature and human affairs. Spirits inhabit places, objects, and ancestors, with no single supreme deity but a shared spiritual essence across cultures.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on communal harmony, respect for ancestors, and environmental stewardship. Moral codes emphasize aloha (Hawaiian love/respect) or fa’a Samoa (Samoan way), promoting generosity and kinship. Taboos protect sacred sites and maintain balance.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000-200,000 adherents across Pacific Islands (Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji), with most (~80%) practicing Christianity. Traditional beliefs persist in cultural practices, with small revivalist groups in urban areas.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity dominates due to 19th-century missions, with syncretism in some communities (e.g., Hawaiian churches blending chants). Jesus is often seen as a high spirit or cultural hero, but traditionalists prioritize local gods, viewing Christianity as secondary.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife varies but often involves a spiritual realm (e.g., Pulotu in Tonga, Hawaiki in Polynesia) where spirits join ancestors. No universal heaven/hell; rituals ensure peaceful transitions, with ancestors guiding the living.[^29][^30]
