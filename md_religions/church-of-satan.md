text# Church of Satan (LaVeyan)
## Introduction
The Church of Satan, founded in 1966 by Anton LaVey in the US, promotes atheistic Satanism as a philosophy of individualism and self-indulgence.
## View on God
LaVeyan Satanism is atheistic, rejecting gods. Satan symbolizes rebellion and human nature.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-interest. Moral codes include responsibility and indulgence. Taboos involve conformity.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000â€“50,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a mythical figure, not divine. Christianity is rejected as oppressive.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife; death is final. No heaven/hell; focus is earthly life.[^10]
