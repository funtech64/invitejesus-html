text# Discordianism
## Introduction
Discordianism is a satirical, parody religion founded in 1958 by Greg Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley in the United States. Centered on Eris, the Greek goddess of discord, it uses humor and absurdity to challenge dogma and promote individual freedom.
## View on God
Discordianism is non-theistic or playfully polytheistic, with Eris as a symbolic deity of chaos and creativity. No literal gods are worshipped; the divine is a metaphor for disorder and personal liberation, often treated with irreverence.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are fluid, emphasizing creativity, humor, and questioning authority. The Principia Discordia encourages "thinking for yourself" and rejecting rigid moral codes. Taboos include taking dogma seriously or suppressing individuality.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 adherents, primarily in the US, UK, and online communities. Growth is limited due to its satirical, non-serious nature.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Discordianism parodies all religions, including Christianity. Jesus is treated as a humorous figure or "saint" in the Principia Discordia, not divine. No serious theological engagement exists; Christianity is mocked as part of broader religious satire.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Discordianism lacks a serious afterlife doctrine, often joking about reincarnation or chaotic spiritual realms. The "afterlife" is a playful concept, with no heaven/hell; adherents may invent personal beliefs. Rituals are performative, focusing on humor rather than eschatology.[^9][^10]
