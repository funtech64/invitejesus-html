text# Lakota Vision Quest
## Introduction
The Lakota Vision Quest, practiced by the Lakota people in the US, is a traditional rite of spiritual seeking, involving fasting and prayer for divine guidance.
## View on God
The Vision Quest is monotheistic, worshiping Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit) as the supreme creator, with spirits as intermediaries.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual connection and community. Moral codes include respect, prayer, and sacrifice. Taboos involve disrespecting spirits.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 participants, primarily in the US (Great Plains). Growth is tied to Lakota population.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit or prophet. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm. No heaven/hell; vision quests prepare the soul for harmony.[^5]
