text# Ananda Marga
## Introduction
Ananda Marga, founded in 1955 by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar in India, is a spiritual movement blending yoga, meditation, and social service for self-realization.
## View on God
Ananda Marga is monistic, viewing God as infinite consciousness (Brahma). No personal deity is central.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual freedom and social justice. Moral codes include yoga, nonviolence, and service. Taboos involve harm and egoism.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is modest.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual master, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation (moksha). No heaven/hell; yoga prepares the soul.[^10]
