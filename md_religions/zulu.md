text# Zulu Traditional Belief
## Introduction
Zulu traditional belief is the indigenous spirituality of the Zulu people of South Africa, focusing on a supreme creator, ancestors, and harmony with nature. It is expressed through rituals, divination, and oral traditions.
## View on God
Zulu religion is monotheistic with animistic elements. Unkulunkulu is the supreme creator, the "Great One" who originated life but is distant. Ancestors (amadlozi) and spirits mediate, influencing daily life and natural forces.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize respect for ancestors, community, and nature. Moral codes promote ubuntu (humanity), including compassion, respect, and communal responsibility. Taboos include disrespecting elders or sacred spaces, with divination guiding moral choices.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 2-3 million Zulu (out of ~12 million) practice traditional beliefs, primarily in South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal). Most (~70%) are Christian, with traditional practices declining but persisting in rural areas.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through colonial missions, with Unkulunkulu sometimes equated with the Christian God. Jesus is seen as a spiritual figure or healer, but traditionalists prioritize ancestors, viewing Christianity as compatible but secondary.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, where amadlozi guide the living. Good lives lead to revered status; evil causes unrest. No heaven/hell; rituals like umhlahlo (divination) ensure spiritual harmony.[^49][^50]
