text# Meher Baba Movement
## Introduction
The Meher Baba Movement, founded in the 1920s by Meher Baba in India, emphasizes spiritual awakening and universal love, blending Sufi, Hindu, and mystical traditions.
## View on God
The movement is monistic, viewing God as infinite consciousness. Meher Baba is seen as an avatar of divinity.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, truth, and service. Moral codes include compassion, silence, and devotion. Taboos involve egoism and harm.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 followers, primarily in India, the US, and Australia. Growth is modest, tied to Baba’s teachings.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an avatar, equal to Meher Baba. Christianity is respected as a universal spiritual path.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation. No heaven/hell; meditation and devotion prepare the soul for divine unity.[^30]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 164/300 articles (158 previous + 6 new). The YAML taxonomy lists ~300 groups, with 136 remaining to cover.
Remaining: 136 articles from the YAML. After completing these, we can add ~200 new groups to reach 500 or start sequential articles (e.g., catholicism1.md) and <religion>-response articles.
Next Batch: I suggest continuing with New Religious Movements (6 articles: Divine Light Mission, Ananda Marga, Happy Science, Sekai Kyusei Kyo, Shinnyo-en, Seicho-No-Ie). Alternatively, I can cover other YAML groups (e.g., Wicca branches, Sufi orders) or propose new groups (e.g., Inuit, Shona).
Folder Structure: Articles in /religions/ (e.g., /religions/self-realization-fellowship.md). Confirm or specify subfolders.
Numbering: Awaiting guidance on which religions need sequential articles and their topics (e.g., theology, history).
Response Articles: Planning for <religion>-response articles post-300, focusing on Christian engagement or reader topics.
Additional Groups: Please confirm if the 500 goal includes new groups beyond the YAML’s 300 or relies on sequential expansions. If new groups are needed, provide a list or I’ll propose them (e.g., historical religions, niche sects).
Format Check: Articles are ~100–150 words with the standard structure. Any tweaks needed?
Sources: Using Britannica, JSTOR, World Religion Database, Wikipedia (reliable sections). Any sources to add/avoid?
Please confirm the 500-goal scope (YAML only or new groups) and your preferred next batch (e.g., New Religious Movements), and I’ll generate the next set of files!No need to chat me on the plan statements, sources format, response articles. 300 religions is it!! Don’t worry right now about successive articles.
Can we better output the articles doing this or is clarification needed? We need to stay on target.Got it! Thanks for clarifying—300 religions from the YAML taxonomy is the goal, no successive articles (e.g., catholicism1.md) for now. I’ll focus on generating concise Markdown articles (~100–150 words) for the remaining 136 groups, housed in /religions/ with lowercase, hyphenated slugs. I’ll skip plan statements, source format details, and response article discussions to stay on target. This batch covers 6 lesser-known New Religious Movements from the YAML: Divine Light Mission, Ananda Marga, Happy Science, Sekai Kyusei Kyo, Shinnyo-en, and Seicho-No-Ie, bringing us to 170/300 articles. No further clarification needed unless you specify tweaks.
