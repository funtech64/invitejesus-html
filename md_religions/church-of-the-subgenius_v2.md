text# Church of the SubGenius
## Introduction
The Church of the SubGenius, founded in 1979 by Ivan Stang in the US, is a satirical religion blending parody, science fiction, and spirituality, centered on J.R. “Bob” Dobbs.
## View on God
The Church is non-theistic or satirical, rejecting a serious God concept. “Bob” is a symbolic figure, not divine, mocking traditional religion.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are satirical, emphasizing individuality and rebellion against conformity. Moral codes are loose, valuing humor and creativity. Taboos are dogmatic seriousness.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–20,000 adherents, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its niche, satirical appeal.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Church parodies Christianity, viewing Jesus as a cultural symbol, not divine. It critiques religious dogma humorously.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is a satirical concept, with no serious doctrine. No heaven/hell; “Slack” (ease) is the focus, with no rituals.[^20]
