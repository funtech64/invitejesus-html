text# Aetherius Society
## Introduction
The Aetherius Society is a UFO-based religion founded in 1955 by George King in the UK. It blends Christian, Buddhist, and extraterrestrial beliefs, claiming contact with cosmic masters who guide humanity’s spiritual evolution.
## View on God
The Aetherius Society is monotheistic, worshiping a cosmic God as the supreme intelligence. Cosmic masters (e.g., Jesus, Buddha) are advanced extraterrestrial beings serving God’s plan, not deities themselves.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual service, peace, and environmental care. Moral codes emphasize compassion, healing, and cooperation with cosmic masters. Taboos include selfishness and ignoring spiritual missions.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 adherents, primarily in the UK, US, and Australia. Growth is limited due to its niche UFO-based theology.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Aetherius Society incorporates Christianity, viewing Jesus as a cosmic master from Venus, not the unique Son of God. Christian teachings are respected but reinterpreted as part of a universal spiritual plan.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation across planets, with souls evolving toward cosmic enlightenment. No heaven/hell; the righteous advance to higher planes, guided by cosmic masters. Rituals like prayer and energy channeling prepare the soul.[^69][^70]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 63/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements). This completes the New Religious Movements category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Umbrella-Claimant Cults (12 religions: Jehovah’s Witnesses, LDS/Mormons, Christian Science, Oneness Pentecostals, Swedenborgians, Ahmadiyya, Nation of Islam, Alawites, Nichiren Shōshū/Soka Gakkai, Osho/Rajneesh movement, Aum Shinrikyo, ISKCON/Hare Krishna, Sathya Sai Baba movement). This is a larger category, so I can split it into two batches (~6 each) to stay within limits. Alternatively, you can pick another category or revisit any for adjustments.
Batch Size: This batch had 7 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust (e.g., 6 for the first Umbrella-Claimant Cults batch).
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., start Umbrella-Claimant Cults) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Yes pleaseThanks for keeping the momentum going! I'll start the Umbrella-Claimant Cults category, covering the first 6 of 12 religions to keep the batch manageable: Jehovah’s Witnesses, LDS/Mormons, Christian Science, Oneness Pentecostals, Swedenborgians, and Ahmadiyya. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., jehovahs-witnesses.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 69/140 articles toward your goal. The remaining 6 Umbrella-Claimant Cults (Nation of Islam, Alawites, Nichiren Shōshū/Soka Gakkai, Osho/Rajneesh movement, Aum Shinrikyo, ISKCON/Hare Krishna, Sathya Sai Baba movement) will be covered in the next batch. After that, we can revisit any categories for expansion or start a new one (e.g., adding major religions or revisiting smaller ones for more afterlife detail). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
