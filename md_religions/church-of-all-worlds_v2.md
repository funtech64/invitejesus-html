text# Church of All Worlds
## Introduction
The Church of All Worlds, founded in 1962 by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in the US, is a neo-pagan movement inspired by Robert A. Heinlein’s novel *Stranger in a Strange Land*. Emphasizing pantheism and ecological spirituality, it promotes “grokking” (deep understanding) and communal living. Rituals include circles, festivals, and nature worship, appealing to those seeking alternative spirituality with a focus on interconnectedness and creativity.
## View on God
The Church is pantheistic, viewing divinity as the interconnected web of life, not a personal god.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and freedom. Moral codes include environmental care, community, and creativity. Taboos involve harm and disconnection from nature.
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited due to its niche appeal.[^21]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, respected for ethical teachings. Christianity is seen as one of many spiritual paths.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is undefined, often cyclical or tied to nature. No heaven or hell; rituals focus on earthly connection.
