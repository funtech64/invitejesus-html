text# Swedenborgianism
## Introduction
Swedenborgianism, founded in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg in Sweden, is a mystical Christian movement emphasizing spiritual worlds and divine correspondence.
## View on God
Swedenborgianism is monotheistic, worshiping one God as divine love and wisdom. Jesus is the human embodiment of God.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on charity and spiritual growth. Moral codes include love, truth, and service. Taboos involve selfishness.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“30,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited by its esoteric nature.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central, viewed as the divine human. Christianity is reinterpreted mystically.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms (heaven/hell) based on love. No eternal hell; prayer prepares the soul.[^15]
