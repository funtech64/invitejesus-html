text# Ramakrishna Mission
## Introduction
The Ramakrishna Mission, founded in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda in India, is a spiritual movement rooted in Vedanta, promoting universal religion and service. Inspired by Sri Ramakrishna’s mystical experiences, it integrates Hindu practices with social work, education, and interfaith dialogue. Centers worldwide offer meditation, *puja*, and charity, appealing to those seeking spiritual unity and humanitarianism. Vivekananda’s Chicago speech (1893) globalized its influence.
## View on God
The Mission is monistic, viewing God as Brahman, the universal reality, manifest in all religions’ deities.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on service and spiritual unity. Moral codes include nonviolence, charity, and truth. Taboos involve intolerance and egoism, obstructing universal harmony.
## Demographics
Approximately 200,000–500,000 followers, primarily in India and the diaspora. Growth is steady through service initiatives.[^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a divine incarnation, respected alongside other avatars. Christianity is seen as a valid path, equal to Hinduism.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or liberation (*moksha*). No heaven or hell; spiritual practices prepare the soul for unity with Brahman.
