text# Unification Church
## Introduction
The Unification Church, founded in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon in South Korea, is a Christian-based new religion emphasizing divine marriage, world peace, and the establishment of God’s kingdom. Known as “Moonies,” it blends Christian and Eastern spiritual elements.
## View on God
The Unification Church is monotheistic, worshiping God as the Heavenly Parent, a dual-natured (masculine/feminine) creator. God seeks to restore humanity through the True Parents (Moon and his wife), with Jesus as a key figure but not divine.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on family, love, and global unity. Moral codes include chastity, fidelity, and service, with the Divine Principle (Moon’s teachings) guiding behavior. Taboos include selfishness and marital infidelity.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million adherents globally, primarily in South Korea, Japan, and the US, with smaller communities in Europe and Africa. Growth has slowed due to controversy and Moon’s death in 2012.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The Unification Church is rooted in Christianity, viewing Jesus as a central figure who partially fulfilled God’s plan but failed to establish a divine family. Moon is seen as the Second Coming, completing Jesus’ mission. The church uses Christian scriptures but reinterprets them through the Divine Principle.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm where souls progress toward God’s kingdom based on earthly deeds. The righteous join God’s ideal world, while the wicked face purification in a temporary spiritual state. No eternal hell exists; the Blessing Ceremony (mass weddings) aids spiritual restoration for the afterlife.[^19][^20]
