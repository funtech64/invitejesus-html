## Introduction
Maya religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the Maya people, practiced in Mesoamerica (circa 2000 BCE–1500 CE) and preserved in texts like the *Popol Vuh*. It emphasizes cosmic balance, deities, and rituals, with modern revivals.
## View on God
Maya religion is polytheistic, with deities like Itzamna (creator), Chaac (rain), and Kukulkan (feathered serpent) governing natural and cosmic forces. No single supreme God; spirits and ancestors are also revered.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on maintaining cosmic harmony through rituals and community. Moral codes emphasize respect for deities, reciprocity, and sacrifice (e.g., bloodletting). Taboos include disrupting divine order or neglecting rituals.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
No widespread adherents today; extinct as a dominant religion by the 16th century CE. Modern Maya (5–7 million in Guatemala, Mexico) blend traditional practices with Catholicism. Revivals number fewer than 50,000.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Spanish colonization introduced Christianity, with some Maya equating Jesus with deities like Kukulkan or Itzamna. Traditionalists prioritize Maya gods, but syncretism is common, with Jesus seen as a healer or divine figure.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves Xibalba, an underworld where souls face trials. The righteous may ascend to a paradise or join ancestors; no eternal hell. Rituals like burials and offerings ensured safe passage and divine favor.[^9][^10]
