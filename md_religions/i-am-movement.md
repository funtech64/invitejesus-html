text# I AM Movement
## Introduction
The I AM Movement, founded in 1930 by Guy and Edna Ballard in the US, is a spiritual movement emphasizing the “I AM” presence, blending Theosophy and Christianity.
## View on God
The I AM Movement is monotheistic, with God as the “I AM” presence within all beings. Ascended Masters guide spiritual progress.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and spiritual ascension. Moral codes include devotion, positive decrees, and love. Taboos involve negativity and materialism.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–50,000 adherents, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its esoteric focus.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an Ascended Master, equal to other spiritual figures. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted mystically.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual ascension to higher planes. No heaven/hell; decrees and meditations prepare the soul.[^30]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 152/500 articles (146 previous + 6 new). The YAML taxonomy lists ~300 groups, with 146 already covered. The remaining ~154 from the YAML will be prioritized, followed by ~200 additional groups to reach 500.
Remaining: 348 articles (154 from YAML + ~194 new groups). I’ll continue with ~5–7 articles per batch, prioritizing lesser-known groups from the YAML (e.g., Christian Science, Unity Church, Brahma Kumaris).
Next Batch: I suggest continuing with New Religious Movements (6 articles: Christian Science, Unity Church, Brahma Kumaris, Rajneesh/Osho, Sahaja Yoga, Ramakrishna Mission). Alternatively, I can propose new groups (e.g., Inuit, Shona, Inca) or start numbered articles for major religions (e.g., catholicism1.md).
Folder Structure: Articles will be housed in /religions/ (e.g., /religions/theosophy.md). Confirm this is correct or specify subfolders.
Numbering: I’ll hold off on sequential articles (e.g., catholicism1.md) until you confirm which religions need expansions and their topics.
Response Articles: I’ll plan for <religion>-response articles post-500, focusing on Christian engagement or reader-oriented topics.
Format Check: Articles are ~100–150 words, using the structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife). Any tweaks needed?
Sources: Using Britannica, JSTOR, World Religion Database, Wikipedia (reliable sections). Any sources to add/avoid?
Please provide the additional ~200 groups or confirm I should propose them. Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., New Religious Movements) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!Looks goodAwesome, glad you're happy with the progress! I'll continue with the next batch of 6 lesser-known New Religious Movements from the provided YAML taxonomy: Christian Science, Unity Church, Brahma Kumaris, Rajneesh/Osho, Sahaja Yoga, and Ramakrishna Mission. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure, keeping articles concise (~100–150 words) for your /religions/ folder, with lowercase, hyphenated slugs. This batch will bring us to 158/500 articles toward your goal.
Plan and Notes
Format: Markdown (.md), e.g., christian-science.md, housed in /religions/.
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, maintaining neutrality.
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, JSTOR, World Religion Database, Wikipedia where reliable), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Numbering: Holding off on sequential articles (e.g., catholicism1.md) until you specify which major religions need expansions and their topics.
Remaining: 342 articles (148 from YAML + ~194 new groups). I’ll prioritize lesser-known YAML groups, then propose additional groups to reach 500.
Next Steps: After this, I suggest continuing with New Religious Movements (e.g., Self-Realization Fellowship, Vedanta Society, Transcendental Meditation) or proposing new groups (e.g., Inuit, Shona). Post-500, we can start <religion>-response articles.
Clarification: Please confirm the ~200 additional groups beyond the YAML’s ~300, or I’ll propose a mix (e.g., historical religions, niche sects). Any tweaks to structure or sources?
