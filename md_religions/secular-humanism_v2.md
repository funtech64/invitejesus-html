text# Secular Humanism
## Introduction
Secular Humanism, formalized in the 20th century, is a non-theistic philosophy emphasizing reason, ethics, and human flourishing without religion.
## View on God
Secular Humanism rejects gods, focusing on human potential and scientific inquiry.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on human well-being. Moral codes include empathy, justice, and reason. Taboos involve dogma.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 50â€“100 million adherents, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is steady.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, valued for ethics but not divine. Christianity is critiqued for faith-based claims.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife; death is final. Focus is on earthly life.[^20]
