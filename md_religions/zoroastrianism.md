text# Zoroastrianism
## Introduction
Zoroastrianism is one of the world’s oldest continuously practiced religions, founded by the prophet Zoroaster (Zarathustra) in ancient Persia (modern Iran) around the 2nd millennium BCE. It emphasizes a dualistic cosmology and ethical living, influencing Abrahamic faiths.
## View on God
Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, centered on Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lord, who is omniscient, omnipotent, and the creator of all. Opposing Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), a destructive spirit, creating a cosmic dualism between good and evil. Lesser divinities (yazatas) assist Ahura Mazda.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are rooted in the triad of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. Moral codes emphasize truth (asha), charity, and fighting evil (druj). Rituals like fire and water purification reinforce ethical purity. Taboos include lying and polluting nature.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 adherents globally, primarily in India (Parsis), Iran, and diaspora communities (US, UK, Canada). Declining due to low birth rates and conversion restrictions, with ~60,000 in India.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Zoroastrianism predates Christianity but influenced its concepts (e.g., heaven/hell, final judgment). It has no direct view on Jesus, as he is absent from Zoroastrian texts. Some modern Zoroastrians view Jesus as a moral teacher or prophet-like figure, but he holds no theological role. Historical interactions were minimal, though early Christian communities in Persia coexisted with Zoroastrians.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a judgment at the Chinvat Bridge, where souls are weighed based on deeds. Righteous souls enter Garothman (House of Song), a paradise with Ahura Mazda; the wicked fall into a不思議

Assuming you meant to continue, I'll complete the **zoroastrianism.md** file and provide the other five files (**mandaeism.md**, **yazidism.md**, **samaritanism.md**, **druze.md**, **manichaeism.md**) as requested, maintaining the same structure and focus. Let me know if you have any additional instructions or if you meant to add something specific!Sounds great!Awesome, thanks for the confirmation! I'll complete the Ancient / Historical Survivals category by generating Markdown files for all six religions: Zoroastrianism (finishing the incomplete file), Mandaeism, Yazidism, Samaritanism, Druze, and Manichaeism. Each file will follow the established format:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., zoroastrianism.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics (emphasized for smaller religions), Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail). Historical details included as these are Abrahamic or Abrahamic-adjacent.

Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics, history, and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch completes the category, bringing us to 18/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Indian Subcontinent Minorities (4 religions) or East Asian New Religions (7 religions) to continue top-to-bottom. Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
