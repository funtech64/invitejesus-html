text# Happy Science
## Introduction
Happy Science (Kofuku-no-Kagaku), founded in 1986 by Ryuho Okawa in Japan, is a new religious movement emphasizing spiritual enlightenment and universal love.
## View on God
Happy Science is monotheistic, worshiping El Cantare, a supreme spiritual being. Okawa is seen as its incarnation.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, wisdom, and self-reflection. Moral codes include compassion and spiritual study. Taboos involve negativity and harm.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000â€“1 million followers, primarily in Japan, with global centers. Growth is limited by controversy.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual master, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected within a universal framework.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or spiritual realms. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for enlightenment.[^15]
