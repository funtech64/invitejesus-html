text# Ayyavazhi
## Introduction
Ayyavazhi is a 19th-century monotheistic religion from South India, particularly Tamil Nadu, rooted in Hindu traditions but distinct in its theology. Founded by Ayya Vaikundar, it emphasizes social reform, equality, and devotion to a supreme God.
## View on God
Ayyavazhi is monotheistic, worshiping Narayana (Vishnu) as the supreme God, manifested as Ayya Vaikundar to reform the world. Lesser deities from Hinduism (e.g., Shiva, Brahma) are acknowledged but subordinate. God is eternal and benevolent, guiding humanity toward dharma.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on equality, nonviolence, and devotion to God. Moral codes reject caste discrimination, promote charity, and emphasize dharma (righteous living). Practices like vegetarianism and community feasts (naveena anna dharmam) reinforce communal harmony.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 700,000–1 million adherents, mostly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, India, with small diaspora communities. Growth is limited due to regional focus and lack of proselytization.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Ayyavazhi shares historical context with Christian missionary activity in 19th-century South India but has no direct theological engagement with Jesus. Some Ayyavazhi followers view Jesus as a righteous teacher or avatar-like figure, but he is not central. The religion’s emphasis on social reform parallels Christian teachings, but its Hindu roots keep it distinct.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
Ayyavazhi believes in reincarnation driven by karma, with the soul cycling through births until achieving moksha (liberation) by following Vaikundar’s teachings. The righteous attain a divine state in Vaikunda Pathi, a spiritual paradise, while the wicked face temporary suffering in lower realms. Rituals like Tavam (penance) and festivals prepare the soul for liberation.[^19][^20]
