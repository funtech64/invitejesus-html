text# Sathya Sai Baba Movement
## Introduction
The Sathya Sai Baba Movement, founded in the 1940s by Sathya Sai Baba in India, emphasizes devotion, service, and universal spirituality.
## View on God
The movement is monistic, viewing God as Brahman. Sai Baba is an avatar of divinity.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and service. Moral codes include charity, nonviolence, and devotion. Taboos involve egoism.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 5â€“10 million followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is steady.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is an avatar, equal to Sai Baba. Christianity is respected as a universal path.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until moksha. No heaven/hell; devotion prepares the soul.[^15]
