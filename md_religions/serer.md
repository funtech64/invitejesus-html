text# Serer
## Introduction
Serer religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of the Serer people in Senegal and The Gambia, centered on a supreme creator and ancestor worship. It emphasizes rituals, cosmology, and maintaining balance with the divine.
## View on God
Serer religion is monotheistic, worshiping Roog as the supreme creator, transcendent and all-knowing. Lesser spirits (pangool) and ancestors mediate divine power, tied to nature and community.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony, respect for ancestors, and community unity. Moral codes emphasize truth, hospitality, and ritual observance. Taboos include disrespecting pangool or violating sacred customs.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million Serer people, primarily in Senegal and The Gambia, with many practicing traditional beliefs alongside Christianity or Islam. Adherence is declining due to religious conversion.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through colonial missions, with some Serer blending Jesus with Roog or pangool. Traditionalists prioritize Serer cosmology, viewing Jesus as a foreign figure or healer. Syncretism occurs in Christian communities.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to sacred trees or lands. No heaven/hell; reincarnation is possible. Rituals like funerals and offerings ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral connection.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 104/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions). This completes the African Traditional Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Ancient Near Eastern Religions (4 religions: Mesopotamian, Canaanite, Egyptian, Zoroastrianism) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., East Asian Traditional Religions like Taoism, Confucianism) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Ancient Near Eastern Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!pleaseThanks for keeping the momentum going! I'll proceed with the Ancient Near Eastern Religions category, covering 4 religions: Mesopotamian, Canaanite, Egyptian, and Zoroastrianism. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., mesopotamian.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 108/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I ascension I suggest moving to East Asian Traditional Religions (e.g., Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, Cheondoism, Won Buddhism) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
