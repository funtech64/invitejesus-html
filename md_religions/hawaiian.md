## Introduction
Hawaiian religion is the indigenous spiritual tradition of Native Hawaiians, centered on reverence for nature, ancestors, and deities like Kāne and Pele. It emphasizes oral traditions, hula, and rituals to maintain harmony with the cosmos.
## View on God
Hawaiian religion is polytheistic and animistic, with major deities including Kāne (creator), Kū (war), Lono (fertility), and Pele (volcanoes). Spirits (ʻaumākua) inhabit nature and ancestors, with no single supreme God.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on kapu (sacred laws), respect for nature, and community harmony. Moral codes emphasize aloha (love), reciprocity, and environmental stewardship. Taboos include violating sacred sites or disrespecting deities.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 Native Hawaiians practice traditional beliefs, primarily in Hawaii, often alongside Christianity. Adherence is declining due to cultural assimilation and Christian dominance.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 19th-century missionaries, with many Hawaiians blending Jesus with deities like Lono. Traditionalists prioritize Hawaiian gods, viewing Jesus as a foreign figure or healer. Syncretism is common in Christian communities.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves souls joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to sacred places like volcanic craters. No heaven/hell; souls may linger or reincarnate. Rituals like hula and offerings ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral guidance.[^9][^10]
