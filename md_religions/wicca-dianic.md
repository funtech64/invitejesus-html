text# Wicca (Dianic)
## Introduction
Dianic Wicca, founded in the 1970s by Zsuzsanna Budapest in the US, is a feminist neo-pagan religion focusing on the Goddess and women’s spirituality.
## View on God
Dianic Wicca is monotheistic or polytheistic, worshiping the Goddess (often Diana) as primary. Male deities are secondary or absent.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics follow the Wiccan Rede, emphasizing feminist values. Moral codes include empowerment, nature reverence, and ritual. Taboos involve harm and patriarchy.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its feminist focus.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often rejected due to perceived patriarchal roots.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or a Goddess-centered realm. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul for spiritual cycles.[^15]
