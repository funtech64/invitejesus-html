text# Ifá
## Introduction
Ifá, a divination system within Yoruba religion, originating in Nigeria, is a spiritual practice centered on Orunmila, the deity of wisdom, guiding followers.
## View on God
Ifá is polytheistic, venerating Olodumare as the supreme creator and Orunmila as the wisdom deity among Orishas.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on balance and destiny. Moral codes include divination, respect, and community. Taboos involve ignoring Orisha guidance.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 5–10 million practitioners, primarily in Nigeria and diaspora (Americas). Growth is tied to Yoruba traditions.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as an Orisha. Christianity is blended in diaspora practices.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; divination prepares the soul.[^10]
