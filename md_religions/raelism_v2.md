text# Raëlism
## Introduction
Raëlism is a UFO religion founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (Raël) in France, teaching that humans were created by extraterrestrials (Elohim). It emphasizes science and peace.
## View on God
Raëlism is atheistic, rejecting a supernatural God. The Elohim are advanced extraterrestrials, not deities, who created life.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, freedom, and scientific progress. Moral codes include nonviolence and sensual meditation. Taboos include aggression and dogmatism.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in Europe, the US, and Japan. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Raëlism views Jesus as a human prophet sent by the Elohim, not divine. Christianity is seen as a precursor to Raëlian truth.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves cloning by the Elohim for eternal life. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for technological immortality.[^25]
