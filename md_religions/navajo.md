## Introduction
Navajo (Diné) religion is an indigenous spiritual tradition of the Navajo people in the southwestern United States, centered on harmony (hózhó) with the universe. It emphasizes oral traditions, ceremonies, and balance with nature.
## View on God
Navajo religion is polytheistic and animistic, with no single supreme God. Key deities include Changing Woman, Spider Woman, and Holy People (Diyin Dineʼé), who govern natural and spiritual forces. The universe is alive with spirits in landscapes and elements.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on hózhó, a state of balance, beauty, and harmony. Moral codes emphasize respect for nature, family, and community, with ceremonies like the Blessingway promoting ethical living. Taboos include disrupting harmony or disrespecting sacred sites.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000–400,000 Navajo people in the US (Arizona, New Mexico), with most practicing traditional religion alongside Christianity or the Native American Church. Adherence is stable but faces cultural erosion.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Navajo religion has coexisted with Christianity since missionary contact in the 19th century. Jesus is often seen as a foreign spiritual figure or healer, respected but not central. Some Navajos blend Christian elements, but traditionalists prioritize Holy People.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is not heavily emphasized; souls may join ancestors in a spiritual realm or linger near sacred sites. No clear heaven/hell; the focus is on maintaining hózhó in life. Ceremonies like the Enemy Way and burial rituals ensure the deceased’s peaceful transition, preventing restless spirits.[^9][^10]
