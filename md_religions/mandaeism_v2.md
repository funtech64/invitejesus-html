text# Mandaeism
## Introduction
Mandaeism is an ancient Gnostic religion, originating in the 1st–2nd century CE in Mesopotamia, practiced by the Mandaean people. It emphasizes baptism, esoteric knowledge, and lightworld cosmology, based on texts like the *Ginza Rba*.
## View on God
Mandaeism is monotheistic, worshiping the Great Life (Hayyi Rabbi) as the supreme creator of the lightworld. Lesser beings (uthras) mediate divine power; no Trinity or anthropomorphic God.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity, truth, and devotion to the Great Life. Moral codes emphasize frequent baptisms, charity, and community unity. Taboos include impurity, lying, and harming life.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 60,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in Iraq, Iran, and diaspora (US, Australia). Declining due to persecution and migration.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Mandaeism views Jesus as a false messiah or misguided figure, with John the Baptist as the true prophet. Christianity is rejected as a corruption, though some Mandaean texts engage with Christian figures.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul’s ascent to the Lightworld, a divine realm of purity. The righteous join the Great Life; the wicked face temporary punishment. Frequent baptisms and rituals prepare the soul for ascent.[^39][^40]
