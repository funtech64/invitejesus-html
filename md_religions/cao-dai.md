text# Cao Dai
## Introduction
Cao Dai, or Caodaism, is a syncretic religion founded in 1926 in southern Vietnam by Ngô Văn Chiêu. It blends elements of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, and Vietnamese spiritism, aiming to unite all faiths under a universal divine vision.
## View on God
Cao Dai is monotheistic, worshiping Cao Đài (High Tower), the supreme God, depicted as a divine eye. Cao Đài is the creator and ruler of the universe, overseeing a hierarchy of spirits, including Buddha, Confucius, and Jesus. Lesser deities and ancestors serve as intermediaries.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize harmony, compassion, and spiritual evolution. Moral codes include nonviolence, truthfulness, vegetarianism (for clergy), and charity, drawn from Buddhist and Confucian principles. Rituals and meditation promote ethical living and unity with the divine.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 2–6 million adherents, primarily in Vietnam (especially Tay Ninh province), with diaspora communities in the US, Australia, and France. Growth is stable but limited by government restrictions in Vietnam.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Cao Dai explicitly incorporates Christianity, viewing Jesus as a divine messenger alongside Buddha and Confucius. He is revered as a saint and prophet, part of the pantheon under Cao Đài. Christian prayers and symbols (e.g., the cross) are used in rituals, reflecting syncretism with Catholicism from French colonial influence.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Cao Dai believes in reincarnation driven by karma, with souls cycling through lives to achieve spiritual perfection. The righteous ascend to heavenly realms closer to Cao Đài, while the wicked face lower rebirths or temporary suffering. At the end of cycles, all souls may attain divine union. Rituals like prayer sessions and offerings prepare the soul for higher rebirth.[^9][^10]
