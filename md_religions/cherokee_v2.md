## Introduction
The Cherokee religion, practiced by the Cherokee people in the US Southeast, emphasizes the Great Spirit and harmony with nature, preserved in myths and rituals.
## View on God
Cherokee religion is monotheistic, worshipping the Great Spirit (Unetlanvhi) as the supreme creator, with lesser spirits in nature.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and community. Moral codes include respect, storytelling, and rituals. Taboos involve disrupting balance.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000â€“400,000 adherents, primarily in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Growth is tied to Cherokee population.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit. Christianity is widely integrated.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm or Nightland. No heaven or hell; rituals ensure the soul's peace.[^20]
