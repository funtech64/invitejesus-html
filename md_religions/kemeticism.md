text# Kemeticism (Egyptian Revival)
## Introduction
Kemeticism is a modern revival of ancient Egyptian religion, emerging in the 20th century. It honors Egyptian gods and emphasizes ma’at (balance, justice) through rituals and reconstruction of ancient practices.
## View on God
Kemeticism is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Ra, Isis, and Osiris, seen as aspects of a divine cosmic order. Some practitioners are monistic, viewing all gods as expressions of a single force (Netjer).[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on ma’at, promoting truth, justice, and harmony. Moral codes include respect for nature, community, and the gods, with taboos against chaos (isfet). Rituals like offerings reinforce ethical living.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–20,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and online communities. Growth is slow due to its esoteric nature.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Kemeticism rejects Christianity, which suppressed ancient Egyptian religion. Jesus is seen as a historical or mythical figure, with no role in Kemetic theology. Some respect his ethical teachings but prioritize Egyptian deities.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves judgment in the Hall of Ma’at, where the heart is weighed against a feather. The righteous enter the Field of Reeds, a paradise; the wicked are devoured. Some believe in reincarnation. Rituals prepare the soul for judgment.[^49][^50]
