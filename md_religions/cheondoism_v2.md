text# Cheondoism
## Introduction
Cheondoism (Cheondogyo) is a Korean religion founded in 1860 by Choe Je-u, blending Confucianism, Taoism, and shamanism. It emphasizes human divinity and social reform, emerging as a response to Western influence.
## View on God
Cheondoism is monotheistic, worshiping Hanulnim (Lord of Heaven), an immanent divine force present in all beings. No lesser deities; Hanulnim is both cosmic and personal.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on human dignity, equality, and harmony with Hanulnim. Moral codes emphasize compassion, truth, and social justice, with practices like meditation fostering ethical living. Taboos include oppression and disrespecting human divinity.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million adherents, primarily in South Korea, with small communities in North Korea and diaspora. Declining due to secularization and competition with Christianity.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Cheondoism respects Jesus as a moral teacher or enlightened figure, but not divine. Christianity is seen as a parallel spiritual path, with some syncretism in Korean Christian communities.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is not heavily emphasized; souls may merge with Hanulnim or join a spiritual realm. No heaven/hell; the focus is on earthly harmony. Rituals like chanting and meditation prepare the soul for unity with the divine.[^39][^40]
