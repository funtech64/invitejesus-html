## Introduction
Ancient Roman religion, practiced from circa 753 BCE to 400 CE, was a polytheistic tradition centered on gods like Jupiter and Mars, blending Etruscan and Greek influences. It emphasized civic rituals and state worship.
## View on God
Roman religion was polytheistic, with gods like Jupiter (sky), Juno (marriage), and Minerva (wisdom) ruling natural and civic domains. No single supreme deity; gods were anthropomorphic, served through temples and oracles.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on pietas (duty to gods, state, family) and civic harmony. Moral codes emphasized loyalty, sacrifice, and justice. Taboos included neglecting rituals or violating sacred laws.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 5th century CE. Historically practiced by millions across the Roman Empire. Modern Roman reconstructionism numbers fewer than 10,000 globally.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Roman religion was replaced by Christianity, which became the state religion by the 4th century CE. Jesus had no role in Roman theology, but early Christians adopted Roman practices like festivals and divine titles.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved the Underworld, where souls resided as shades in a neutral realm. Exceptional souls reached Elysium; the wicked faced punishment. Rituals like funerals and offerings ensured the deadâ€™s peace.[^19][^20]
