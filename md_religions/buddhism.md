## Introduction
Buddhism is a non-theistic religion founded in the 5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in India. Based on the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path, it emphasizes enlightenment through meditation and ethical living.
## View on God
Buddhism is non-theistic, rejecting a creator God. The Buddha is a human teacher, not divine, and deities (e.g., in Mahayana) are symbolic or subordinate to enlightenment. The focus is on universal laws (dharma) and Buddha-nature.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on the Five Precepts: no killing, stealing, lying, intoxication, or sexual misconduct. Compassion and mindfulness guide moral behavior, with meditation fostering ethical growth. Taboos include actions causing suffering.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 520 million adherents (6% of global population), primarily in East Asia (China, Japan), Southeast Asia (Thailand, Sri Lanka), and India. Growth is stable, with increases in Western countries.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Buddhism has minimal engagement with Christianity. Jesus is seen as a wise teacher or bodhisattva-like figure by some, but not divine. Buddhist-Christian dialogue exists in the West, but their cosmologies remain distinct.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with souls cycling through six realms (gods, humans, animals, etc.) until achieving nirvana, liberation from samsara. No heaven/hell; meditation and ethical living prepare the soul for nirvana.[^39][^40]
