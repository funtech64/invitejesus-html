text# Christadelphians
## Introduction
The Christadelphians, founded in the 1840s by John Thomas in the US, are a Christian restorationist group emphasizing biblical literalism and non-trinitarian beliefs. Rejecting mainstream creeds, they focus on scripture study, communal worship, and preparation for Christ’s return. Members, known as “brethren,” meet in small congregations (*ecclesias*) for Bible-based services, often in homes or halls. They emphasize baptism by immersion and a disciplined lifestyle, avoiding military service and political involvement due to their apocalyptic worldview. The group emerged during the Second Great Awakening, appealing to those seeking a return to early Christian practices.
## View on God
Christadelphians are monotheistic, worshiping one God (Yahweh). Jesus is the Son of God, not divine or pre-existent, but exalted by God.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on obedience to scripture. Moral codes include honesty, modesty, and charity. Taboos involve idolatry, violence, and worldly engagement.
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–60,000 followers, primarily in the US, UK, and Australia. Growth is limited due to strict beliefs.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central as the Messiah, not divine. Mainstream Christianity is critiqued for trinitarianism and creeds, but Christadelphians identify as Christian.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves resurrection at Christ’s return for the faithful, who inherit eternal life on Earth. No heaven/hell; the wicked cease to exist.
