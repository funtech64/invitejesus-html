text# Plymouth Brethren
## Introduction
The Plymouth Brethren, founded in the 1820s by John Nelson Darby in the UK, are a Christian movement emphasizing biblical authority, simplicity, and separation from the world. Split into Exclusive and Open branches, they reject formal clergy, meeting in small assemblies for worship, prayer, and Bible study. Known for dispensationalism, they anticipate Christ’s return and practice strict communal discipline. Their worship includes the Lord’s Supper, often weekly, and they avoid secular influences, fostering a distinct identity. The movement emerged during a period of religious revival, appealing to those seeking a purer Christianity.
## View on God
Plymouth Brethren are monotheistic, worshiping one God in Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Jesus is divine, the Son of God.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on biblical obedience. Moral codes include modesty, charity, and separation. Taboos involve worldly entertainment and disobedience.
## Demographics
Approximately 40,000–50,000 followers, primarily in the UK, US, and Australia. Growth is modest due to insularity.[^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central, divine, and the Savior. The Brethren see themselves as true Christians, critiquing mainstream denominations for laxity.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves heaven for the saved and judgment for the unsaved. Rituals like the Lord’s Supper prepare the soul.
