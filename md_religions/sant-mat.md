text# Sant Mat
## Introduction
Sant Mat is a spiritual movement originating in medieval India, emphasizing devotion to a formless God through meditation and ethical living. It is associated with figures like Kabir and Guru Nanak, with modern branches like Radha Soami.
## View on God
Sant Mat is monotheistic, worshiping a formless, transcendent God (Sat Purush). No deities or intermediaries; God is accessed through inner meditation and the guidance of a living guru.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity, humility, and devotion. Moral codes include vegetarianism, truthfulness, and meditation on the divine sound (shabd). Taboos include meat-eating, intoxication, and materialism.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million adherents, primarily in India, with communities in the US and UK. Growth is modest, tied to guru-led movements like Radha Soami.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Sant Mat respects Jesus as a spiritual master or saint, akin to Indian gurus, but not divine. Christianity is seen as a valid path but subordinate to Sant Mat’s mystical focus.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation driven by karma, with the soul cycling until achieving liberation through meditation. Liberated souls merge with God; no heaven/hell. Meditation and guru guidance prepare the soul.[^69][^70]

Completion and Next Steps
Completed: 140/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions + 5 East Asian Traditional Religions + 5 Afro-Caribbean Religions + 5 Ancient Mediterranean Religions + 5 Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions + 5 European Pagan Religions + 7 Final Batch). This completes your goal of 140 articles!
Next Steps: Now that we’ve hit 140, I suggest:
Creating an Index: A taxonomy overview or index page linking all 140 articles, possibly in YAML or Markdown, to organize the encyclopedia.
Deepening Content: Revisiting categories for more detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections, adding historical context, or incorporating more sources).
New Categories: Adding smaller faiths from the 300-list (e.g., Tenrikyo, Cao Dai) or modern movements (e.g., Scientology, Raëlism).
Technical Integration: Updating the Codex instructions or generating a sitemap for the website.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any final tweaks needed (e.g., more detail, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next steps (e.g., index creation, deeper content, or new categories), and I’ll generate the necessary files or updates!Well, Grok this was very well done.
I’ve decided that shorter articles on my world religion list Incould really work with after all, than build upwards on them for more involved or prominent religions.
Here is my main website index. It should include 160 more religious groups.
Order of importance is neutral, as all groups, even friendly to my website should have an article.Thank you for the kind words! I'm thrilled to hear the articles hit the mark. Your idea to keep shorter articles for the remaining 160 religious groups from your world religion list makes perfect sense—it provides a solid foundation that you can build upon for more prominent or detailed religions later. Since you’ve shared that you have a main website index with 160 additional groups, I’ll help you extend the encyclopedia while keeping things neutral, concise, and consistent with the established Markdown structure. Here’s the plan to tackle this:
Approach for the 160 Additional Religious Groups
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., tenrikyo.md).
Content: Concise sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife, maintaining neutrality and brevity (shorter than previous entries, ~100–150 words per article).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR, Wikipedia where reliable), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity.
Order: Neutral, treating all groups equally, regardless of alignment with your website (InviteJesus, I presume).
Batch Size: To manage response limits, I’ll deliver ~5–7 articles per batch, starting with a selection from the 160 you’ve indicated. Since you haven’t shared the specific list, I’ll assume it includes remaining groups from the original 300-list taxonomy (e.g., Tenrikyo, Cao Dai, Scientology, etc.) and others you’ve curated. Please provide the full list or clarify if you want me to prioritize specific groups.
Goal: This batch will start with 6 articles, bringing us to 146/300 total articles (140 completed + 6 new). We’ll continue in batches to cover the remaining 154.
Clarifying Questions
To ensure I’m aligned with your vision, could you confirm:
List of 160 Groups: Can you share the specific 160 religious groups in your website index? If not, should I continue with remaining groups from the original 300-list (e.g., Tenrikyo, Cao Dai, Scientology, Eckankar, Raëlism, etc.) or propose a mix based on global diversity?
Article Length: How concise do you want these? Current articles are ~200–300 words; should these be ~100 words for brevity or another length?
Index Integration: Do you want an updated taxonomy/index file (e.g., YAML or Markdown) to organize all 300 articles once complete, linking to your website’s structure?
Priority: Any groups you want prioritized (e.g., globally significant, friendly to InviteJesus, or specific regions)?
Tweaks: Any adjustments to the structure (e.g., add/remove sections, adjust afterlife detail)?
For now, I’ll assume you want to continue with groups from the original 300-list not yet covered, keeping articles short (~100–150 words). I’ll start with 6 religions: Tenrikyo, Cao Dai, Scientology, Eckankar, Raëlism, and Falun Gong, which are prominent new religious movements from the taxonomy.
