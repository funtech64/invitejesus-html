text# Hopi
## Introduction
The Hopi religion, practiced by the Hopi people in the US Southwest, centers on kachinas (spirits) and harmony with the earth, preserved in ceremonies.
## View on God
Hopi religion is polytheistic, venerating Maasaw (guardian) and kachinas as spirits of nature and ancestors.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and community. Moral codes include respect, rituals, and stewardship. Taboos involve harming nature.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 adherents, primarily in Arizona. Growth is tied to Hopi population.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes seen as a kachina or healer. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual underworld or joining kachinas. No heaven or hell; ceremonies ensure harmony.[^25]
