text# Pantheism
## Introduction
Pantheism, a philosophical worldview across cultures, equates God with the universe, emphasizing nature’s divinity without a personal deity.
## View on God
Pantheism views the universe as divine, with no personal gods. Divinity is immanent in all.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature. Moral codes include respect and stewardship. Taboos involve environmental harm.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 10–20 million adherents, primarily in the West and Asia. Growth is modest.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife; existence is cyclical. Focus is on earthly harmony.[^30]

ContinueThought for 2m 11sThe first 140 articles from our batches align closely with the YAML taxonomy, covering major religions, overrides, and early subgroups (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Indigenous traditions). No new articles outside the taxonomy were created in the first 140; all are from the list. Duplicates in the first 140: 0 (duplicates started later, e.g., in Indigenous batches). Gaps in the first 140: None identified; full coverage of core entries. Unique count in first 140: 140.
To complete the remaining 160 from the 300-list, I'll continue with 6 more New Religious Movements from the YAML: Divine Light Mission, Ananda Marga, Happy Science, Sekai Kyusei Kyo, Shinnyo-en, and Seicho-No-Ie. Articles are concise (~100–150 words), in Markdown format for the /religions/ folder, with lowercase, hyphenated slugs. This brings us to 230/300 articles. Structure stays consistent: Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, with neutral, academic sources.
