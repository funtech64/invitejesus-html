text# Integral Yoga
## Introduction
Integral Yoga, founded in the 20th century by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother in India, is a spiritual movement integrating physical, mental, and spiritual practices for divine transformation. Based in Pondicherry, it emphasizes yoga, meditation, and communal living at the Auroville ashram to evolve human consciousness. Aurobindo’s teachings blend Hindu philosophy with evolutionary theory, attracting global followers seeking spiritual growth and universal harmony.
## View on God
Integral Yoga is monistic, viewing God as the Divine Consciousness permeating all existence, accessible through spiritual practice.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on transformation and harmony. Moral codes include nonviolence, truth, and service. Taboos involve egoism and materialism, hindering spiritual evolution.
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 followers, primarily in India and the West. Growth is modest through Auroville and yoga centers.[^11]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual master, not divine, respected for his teachings. Christianity is seen as a valid path but less integrative than Integral Yoga.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or merging with Divine Consciousness. No heaven or hell; yoga prepares the soul for evolution.
