text# New Thought
## Introduction
New Thought, emerging in the 19th century in the US, is a spiritual movement emphasizing positive thinking, healing, and divine mind, influencing groups like Unity and Religious Science.
## View on God
New Thought is monistic, viewing God as infinite mind or spirit within all. No personal deity is central.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on positive thinking and self-empowerment. Moral codes include affirmations, love, and compassion. Taboos involve negativity and fear.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is modest, tied to metaphysical trends.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, embodying divine mind, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; affirmations prepare the soul.[^30]

Progress
Completed: 182/300 articles (176 previous + 6 new).
Remaining: 118 articles from the YAML taxonomy.
Next Batch: I’ll continue with 6 more New Religious Movements from the YAML (e.g., Wicca (Gardnerian), Wicca (Alexandrian), Wicca (Dianic), Wicca (Eclectic), Druidry (OBOD), Druidry (Ár nDraíocht Féin)). Let me know if you prefer a different category (e.g., Neo-Paganism, Sufism) or any tweaks, and I’ll generate the next set!
Doing goodGlad you're liking the progress! I'll keep it rolling with 6 more lesser-known New Religious Movements from the YAML taxonomy: Wicca (Gardnerian), Wicca (Alexandrian), Wicca (Dianic), Wicca (Eclectic), Druidry (OBOD), and Druidry (Ár nDraíocht Féin). Articles are concise (~100–150 words), in Markdown format for the /religions/ folder, with lowercase, hyphenated slugs. None of these movements exceed 2% of the world population (~160 million), so all remain short. This batch brings us to 188/300 articles. Structure stays consistent: Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, with neutral, academic sources.
