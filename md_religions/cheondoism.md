text# Cheondoism
## Introduction
Cheondoism (Ch’ŏndogyo), founded in 1860 in Korea by Choe Je-u, is a syncretic religion blending Confucianism, Shamanism, and Buddhist elements. It emphasizes human divinity and social reform, aiming for a heavenly kingdom on earth.
## View on God
Cheondoism is monotheistic, worshiping Hanulnim (Lord of Heaven), the supreme divine spirit residing in all humans. No lesser deities are central; Hanulnim is immanent and transcendent, guiding humanity toward enlightenment.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on human dignity, equality, and social justice. Moral codes promote sincerity, respect, and charity, with practices like incantations (Jumun) fostering spiritual growth. Taboos include oppression and selfishness.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–3 million adherents, primarily in South Korea, with small communities in North Korea and diaspora (US, Japan). Growth is limited due to competition with Christianity and Buddhism.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Cheondoism emerged during Christian missionary activity in Korea, but Jesus is not central. Some view him as a moral teacher or divine figure akin to Choe Je-u, but Cheondoism’s focus on Hanulnim and Korean identity keeps it distinct.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
Cheondoism believes in reincarnation and spiritual evolution, with souls progressing toward divine unity with Hanulnim. No heaven/hell; the afterlife is a continuation of earthly cultivation, with rituals like chanting preparing the soul.[^59][^60]
