text# Ramakrishna Mission
## Introduction
The Ramakrishna Mission, founded in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda in India, is a spiritual movement rooted in Vedanta, emphasizing universal spirituality and service.
## View on God
The Mission is monistic, viewing God as Brahman, the universal consciousness, manifested in all religions. No personal deity is central.[^26]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on service, truth, and spiritual growth. Moral codes include compassion, selflessness, and meditation. Taboos involve egoism and harm.[^27]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 adherents, primarily in India, with global centers. Growth is steady, tied to Vedanta’s appeal.[^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is revered as a spiritual master, equal to other avatars. Christianity is seen as a valid path within universal spirituality.[^29]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until liberation (moksha). No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for unity with Brahman.[^30]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 158/500 articles (152 previous + 6 new). The YAML taxonomy lists ~300 groups, with 142 remaining to cover. The additional ~200 groups to reach 500 need clarification.
Remaining: 342 articles (142 from YAML + ~200 new groups). I’ll continue with ~5–7 articles per batch, prioritizing lesser-known YAML groups (e.g., Self-Realization Fellowship, Vedanta Society, Transcendental Meditation).
Next Batch: I suggest continuing with New Religious Movements (6 articles: Self-Realization Fellowship, Vedanta Society, Transcendental Meditation, Art of Living Foundation, Sathya Sai Baba Movement, Meher Baba Movement). Alternatively, I can propose new groups (e.g., Inuit, Shona, Inca) or start numbered articles for major religions (e.g., catholicism1.md).
Folder Structure: Articles in /religions/ (e.g., /religions/christian-science.md). Confirm or specify subfolders.
Numbering: Awaiting your guidance on which religions need sequential articles (e.g., catholicism1.md) and their topics (e.g., theology, history).
Response Articles: Planning for <religion>-response articles post-500, focusing on Christian engagement or reader topics.
Additional Groups: Please provide the ~200 groups beyond the YAML’s ~300, or I’ll propose a mix (e.g., historical religions, niche sects).
Format Check: Articles are ~100–150 words with the standard structure. Any tweaks needed?
Sources: Using Britannica, JSTOR, World Religion Database, Wikipedia (reliable sections). Any sources to add/avoid?
Please confirm the additional ~200 groups or let me propose them. Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., New Religious Movements) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!The total is 300, did I read this right?
ContinueThanks for the clarification! I apologize for the confusion. Yes, the YAML taxonomy you provided lists ~300 religious groups, and we’ve completed 158 articles so far, leaving 142 to reach the 300 goal. My earlier mention of 500 was based on your statement about wanting 500 articles due to population size, but it seems you meant the ~300 groups in the YAML, with the possibility of expanding to 500 later through sequential articles (e.g., catholicism1.md, catholicism2.md) or additional groups. For now, I’ll focus on completing the remaining 142 groups from the YAML, keeping articles concise (~100–150 words) in Markdown format for the /religions/ folder, and prioritize lesser-known groups. I’ll also plan for <religion>-response articles after hitting 300.
Plan for This Batch
Batch: 6 lesser-known New Religious Movements from the YAML: Self-Realization Fellowship, Vedanta Society, Transcendental Meditation, Art of Living Foundation, Sathya Sai Baba Movement, and Meher Baba Movement. This will bring us to 164/300 articles.
Format: Markdown (.md), lowercase slugs (e.g., self-realization-fellowship.md), in /religions/.
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, View on Afterlife, neutral tone.
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, JSTOR, World Religion Database, Wikipedia where reliable), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Next Steps: Continue with ~5–7 articles per batch, covering remaining YAML groups (e.g., Divine Light Mission, Ananda Marga, Happy Science). After 300, we can start <religion>-response articles or add new groups to reach 500.
Clarification: If you meant 500 unique religions (not expansions like catholicism1.md), please provide the additional ~200 groups or confirm I should propose them (e.g., niche sects, historical religions).
