text# Oneness Pentecostals
## Introduction
Oneness Pentecostalism is a Christian movement emerging in the early 20th century in the United States, emphasizing non-Trinitarian theology and baptism in Jesus’ name. It focuses on spiritual gifts and holiness.
## View on God
Oneness Pentecostals are monotheistic, rejecting the Trinity. God is one, manifested as Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit, not separate persons. Jesus is the full embodiment of God.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize holiness, modesty, and devotion. Moral codes include strict dress codes, avoiding worldly vices (e.g., alcohol), and charity. Taboos include sin and non-biblical practices.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 2–5 million adherents, primarily in the US, Africa (e.g., Nigeria), and Latin America. Growth is strong due to charismatic worship and evangelism.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Oneness Pentecostals identify as Christian, centering Jesus as God incarnate and savior. Their non-Trinitarian theology sets them apart from mainstream Christianity, which often views them as unorthodox.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Christian eschatology, with the righteous entering heaven, a paradise with God, and the wicked facing eternal hell. Baptism and spiritual gifts prepare believers for heaven, with an emphasis on the imminent Second Coming.[^39][^40]
