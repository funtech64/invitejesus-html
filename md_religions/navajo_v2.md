## Introduction
The Navajo religion, practiced in the US Southwest, emphasizes harmony (hózhó) and spiritual beings like Changing Woman.
## View on God
Navajo religion is polytheistic, venerating Holy People like Changing Woman. Divinity is in nature.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on hózhó. Moral codes include respect and ceremonies. Taboos involve disrupting balance.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000–400,000 followers, primarily in Arizona and New Mexico. Growth is tied to Navajo population.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; ceremonies ensure hózhó.[^25]
