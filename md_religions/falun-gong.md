text# Falun Gong
## Introduction
Falun Gong, or Falun Dafa, is a Chinese spiritual movement founded in 1992 by Li Hongzhi, blending Buddhist and Taoist principles with qigong exercises. It emphasizes cultivation of truth, compassion, and forbearance for spiritual enlightenment.
## View on God
Falun Gong is nontheistic, rejecting a personal God. Instead, it focuses on universal principles (Zhen, Shan, Ren—truth, compassion, forbearance) and cosmic laws governing existence. Practitioners cultivate their "main spirit" to align with these principles, with no deity worship.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on Zhen-Shan-Ren, promoting honesty, kindness, and tolerance. Practitioners aim to eliminate attachments (e.g., greed, anger) through meditation and moral living. Taboos include deceit and harming others, with cultivation practices guiding ethical behavior.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 2–10 million adherents globally, primarily in China (before 1999 ban), with diaspora communities in the US, Canada, and Australia. Numbers are uncertain due to persecution in China; growth is limited but resilient in exile.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Falun Gong has no direct theological engagement with Christianity or Jesus, focusing on Eastern principles. Some practitioners view Jesus as a moral exemplar aligned with compassion, but he is not central. Persecution in China has led to comparisons with Christian martyrs, but no syncretism exists.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
Falun Gong believes in reincarnation and karma, with the soul (main spirit) cycling through lives to cultivate virtue. Enlightenment (consummation) frees the soul from samsara, achieving a higher spiritual state. No heaven/hell; cultivation determines rebirth quality. Practices like qigong and meditation prepare the soul.[^29][^30]
