text# Quimbanda
## Introduction
Quimbanda is a Brazilian syncretic religion, emerging in the 20th century alongside Umbanda, blending African (Bantu, Yoruba), Catholic, and Spiritist elements. It emphasizes spirits like Exu and Pomba Gira, focusing on magic and spiritual work.
## View on God
Quimbanda is monotheistic with polytheistic elements, recognizing a supreme creator (Zambi or Olorun). Spirits like Exu (trickster) and Pomba Gira are powerful intermediaries, often syncretized with Catholic figures.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual balance, respect for spirits, and pragmatic magic. Moral codes emphasize loyalty to spirits, community service, and ritual precision. Taboos include disrespecting Exu or misusing magical powers.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–500,000 adherents, primarily in Brazil (São Paulo, Rio), with small diaspora communities. Growth is limited due to its esoteric nature and stigma.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Quimbanda incorporates Catholicism, with Jesus sometimes seen as a high spirit or syncretized with an orixá. Practitioners may attend Catholic services, but Exu and Pomba Gira are central, with Jesus peripheral.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or joining spirits in a spiritual realm, influenced by Spiritism. No eternal heaven/hell; rituals like offerings and spirit work ensure spiritual progress and harmony with ancestors.[^49][^50]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 118/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements + 6 Indigenous American Religions + 5 Pacific & Oceanic Religions + 5 African Traditional Religions + 4 Ancient Near Eastern Religions + 5 East Asian Traditional Religions + 5 Afro-Caribbean Religions). This completes the Afro-Caribbean Religions category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Ancient Mediterranean Religions (5 religions: Greek, Roman, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Gnosticism [ancient]) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions like Maya, Aztec) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 5 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Ancient Mediterranean Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!yesThanks for keeping the enthusiasm high! I'll proceed with the Ancient Mediterranean Religions category, covering 5 religions: Greek, Roman, Mithraism, Manichaeism, and Gnosticism (Ancient). Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., greek.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 123/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Indigenous Mesoamerican Religions (e.g., Maya, Aztec, Olmec) or another category, or we can revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
