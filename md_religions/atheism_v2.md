text# Atheism
## Introduction
Atheism, a worldview rejecting belief in gods, emerged historically across cultures, emphasizing reason and evidence over faith.
## View on God
Atheism explicitly denies the existence of any gods or supernatural beings.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on reason and human well-being. Moral codes emphasize empathy and justice. Taboos involve dogma and harm.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 500â€“700 million adherents, primarily in Europe, Asia, and the US. Growth is steady.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often critiqued for faith-based claims.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife; death is final. No heaven/hell; focus is on earthly life.[^5]
