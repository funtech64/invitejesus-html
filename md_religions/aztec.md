text# Aztec
## Introduction
Aztec religion, practiced in Mesoamerica (circa 1300â€“1521 CE), was a polytheistic tradition centered on deities, sacrifice, and cosmic order. Preserved in codices, it influenced Mesoamerican culture until Spanish conquest.
## View on God
Aztec religion was polytheistic, with gods like Huitzilopochtli (war/sun), Quetzalcoatl (wisdom), and Tlaloc (rain). No single supreme deity; gods required human sacrifice to maintain cosmic balance.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on pleasing gods through sacrifice and ritual. Moral codes emphasized loyalty, community, and divine service. Taboos included neglecting sacrifices or disrespecting gods.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 16th century CE. Historically practiced by millions in central Mexico. Modern revivals (Mexica religion) number fewer than 10,000.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Spanish colonization imposed Christianity, with some Aztecs equating Jesus with Quetzalcoatl (feathered serpent). Traditionalists prioritized Aztec gods, but syncretism is common in modern Mexican Catholicism.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife varied by death type: warriors and sacrificial victims joined Huitzilopochtli in a solar paradise; others went to Mictlan (underworld) or other realms. No eternal hell; rituals like sacrifices ensured divine favor.[^19][^20]
