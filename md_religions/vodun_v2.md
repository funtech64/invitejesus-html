text# Vodun (West Africa)
## Introduction
Vodun, a traditional West African faith from Benin, emphasizes spirits (Vodun) and ancestral worship, influencing diaspora religions.
## View on God
Vodun is polytheistic, worshiping Mawu-Lisa as supreme, with Vodun spirits as intermediaries.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect and offerings. Taboos involve disrespecting spirits.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 10â€“15 million followers, primarily in Benin and Togo. Growth is steady.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes syncretized as a spirit. Christianity is integrated in some communities.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^25]
