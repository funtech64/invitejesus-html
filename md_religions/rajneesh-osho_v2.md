text# Rajneesh/Osho
## Introduction
The Rajneesh movement, founded in the 1960s by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) in India, is a spiritual movement blending Eastern mysticism, meditation, and individualism. Known for dynamic meditation and controversial communes, it emphasizes self-awareness and liberation from societal norms. After conflicts in Oregon, US, it rebranded as Osho, with centers worldwide offering meditation retreats. Osho’s teachings, delivered through discourses, attract seekers of personal transformation despite past controversies.
## View on God
The movement is non-theistic, viewing God as consciousness within all, not a personal deity. Divinity is experienced through meditation.
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on freedom and awareness. Moral codes include self-expression, meditation, and love. Taboos involve repression and dogmatism, seen as barriers to enlightenment.
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in India, Europe, and the US. Growth is modest through meditation centers.[^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a mystic, not divine, respected for his compassion. Christianity is seen as restrictive compared to Osho’s eclectic spirituality.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or merging with universal consciousness. No heaven or hell; meditation leads to liberation from the cycle.
