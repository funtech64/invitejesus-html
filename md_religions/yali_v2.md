text# Yali
## Introduction
The Yali cargo cult, emerging in the 1960s in Papua New Guinea, venerates Yali, a messianic figure promising prosperity and independence from colonial rule. It blends indigenous beliefs with Western influences, involving rituals like dances and offerings to prepare for Yali’s return with cargo (goods). The cult reflects anti-colonial sentiment and persists as a cultural movement, often alongside Christianity, in remote Melanesian communities.
## View on God
Yali is monotheistic, viewing Yali as a divine messiah tied to liberation and material wealth. Divinity is linked to cargo.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community hope and solidarity. Moral codes include unity, rituals, and sharing. Taboos involve embracing colonial influences or disbelief.
## Demographics
Approximately 1,000–5,000 followers, primarily in Papua New Guinea. Growth is limited due to its regional focus.[^21]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a spirit, sometimes equated with Yali. Christianity is partially integrated, sharing messianic expectations.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms, with Yali’s return promising abundance. No heaven or hell; rituals prepare the soul.
