text# Umbanda
## Introduction
Umbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion that blends African traditions (especially Yoruba and Bantu), Spiritism, Catholicism, and indigenous elements. Founded in the early 20th century, it focuses on spirit mediumship, healing, and charity through rituals involving music and possession.
## View on God
Umbanda is monotheistic with polytheistic elements. The supreme deity is Olorum or Zambi (equivalent to the Christian God), a transcendent creator. Authority is delegated to orixás (deities like Iemanjá for seas, Oxalá for peace) and spirits (e.g., caboclos as indigenous guides, pretos-velhos as wise elders). These entities act as intermediaries for divine will.[^23][^24]
## View on Ethics
Ethics center on charity, moral evolution, and karma. Practitioners emphasize helping others, humility, and spiritual growth to advance through reincarnation. Moral codes include avoiding harm, respecting nature, and following spirit guidance, with rituals reinforcing virtues like compassion and justice.[^25][^26]
## Demographics
Approximately 0.5-1 million adherents, primarily in Brazil (especially Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), with small communities in Argentina, Uruguay, and the US. Growth is modest; many practice alongside Catholicism or Spiritism.[^27][^28]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Umbanda incorporates Christian elements, viewing Jesus as a high spirit or master (often syncretized with Oxalá). Rituals include Christian prayers, crosses, and saints equated with orixás. It blends with Catholicism, allowing dual practice, though some Christians see it as incompatible due to spiritism.[^29][^30]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation based on karma, with souls evolving through multiple lives toward spiritual perfection. Death leads to a spiritual plane where spirits guide the living; good deeds lead to higher realms, evil to lower ones requiring purification. No eternal hell; focus on progress and charity.[^31][^32]

text# Africa (Traditional Religions)
## Introduction
African Traditional Religions encompass diverse indigenous faiths across sub-Saharan Africa, rooted in oral traditions and centered on ancestors, spirits, and harmony with nature. Practiced by ethnic groups like the Yoruba and Akan, they involve rituals, divination, and festivals to honor deities and ancestors. Despite colonial suppression, these religions persist in rural and urban communities, often blending with Christianity or Islam, shaping cultural practices like music and dance across the continent.
## View on God
African Traditional Religions vary, often monotheistic or polytheistic, worshiping a supreme creator (e.g., Nyame among the Akan) alongside lesser spirits and ancestors. Divinity is immanent in nature and community.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect for elders, reciprocity, and ritual observance. Taboos involve disrespecting ancestors or sacred sites, believed to disrupt harmony.
## Demographics
Approximately 100–200 million followers, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Benin). Growth is tied to cultural revival, with syncretism common.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a spirit or prophet, especially in syncretic churches. Christianity is widely integrated, with traditional rituals complementing Christian practices in many communities.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals like funerals ensure the soul’s connection to ancestors and spiritual harmony.
