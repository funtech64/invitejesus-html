text# Divine Science
## Introduction
Divine Science, founded in the 1880s by Malinda Cramer in the US, is a New Thought movement emphasizing divine presence and healing through spiritual understanding.
## View on God
Divine Science is monistic, viewing God as omnipresent spirit or consciousness. No personal deity is central.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and spiritual growth. Moral codes include prayer, compassion, and positive thinking. Taboos involve fear and negativity.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual exemplar, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted metaphysically.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual continuity or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; prayer prepares the soul.[^25]
