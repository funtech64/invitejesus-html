text# Onmyōdō
## Introduction
Onmyōdō is a traditional Japanese esoteric cosmology, rooted in Shinto, Taoism, and Buddhism, practiced from the 6th century CE. It focuses on divination, astrology, and rituals to harmonize yin-yang energies and protect against spirits.
## View on God
Onmyōdō is polytheistic and animistic, with no single God but a cosmos filled with kami (Shinto spirits) and spiritual forces. Practitioners manipulate yin-yang energies rather than worship a deity, though Shinto kami like Amaterasu are revered.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize balance, purity, and respect for spiritual forces. Moral codes promote harmony with nature and society, with taboos against disrupting cosmic balance. Divination and rituals guide ethical behavior, ensuring protection from malevolent spirits.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Practiced by a small number (~10,000–50,000) in Japan, primarily by Shinto priests or esoteric practitioners. Largely subsumed into Shinto or Buddhism; few exclusive adherents remain due to modernization.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Onmyōdō has minimal engagement with Christianity, as it is rooted in Japanese cosmology. Jesus is not referenced, though some modern practitioners may view him as a foreign spiritual figure. Historical Christian missions in Japan had little impact on Onmyōdō.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife aligns with Shinto beliefs, with souls transitioning to a spiritual realm or becoming kami. No heaven/hell; spirits may linger or reincarnate based on earthly actions. Rituals like purification ensure peaceful transitions, with ancestors guiding the living.[^39][^40]
