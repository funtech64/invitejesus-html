text# Atheism
## Introduction
Atheism is the absence or rejection of belief in God or gods, often tied to rationalism, naturalism, and secular worldviews. It is not a religion but a philosophical stance.
## View on God
Atheism denies the existence of God or gods, viewing theistic claims as false or improbable. God concepts (e.g., anthropomorphic like Zeus or abstract like in monotheism) are seen as incoherent or unsupported by evidence. Strong atheism asserts no gods exist; weak atheism lacks belief without certainty.[^15][^16]
## View on Afterlife
Atheists generally reject an afterlife, viewing death as the end of consciousness. No heaven, hell, or reincarnation; existence is material and finite. Some (7% in U.S.) believe in nonspecific afterlife, but most (26% no heaven/hell) see no evidence for survival beyond death.[^17][^18]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are humanist/secular, derived from reason, empathy, and society rather than divine commands. Moral codes can be established without gods, emphasizing human well-being, justice, and rights. Influences include utilitarianism or virtue ethics, rejecting religious authority.[^19][^20]
## Demographics
~500-700 million globally (~7% of population), with higher rates in Europe (e.g., 20-30% in some countries) and China (~50% nontheistic). In U.S., ~26% nonreligious, including atheists. Growth via secularization, but varies by region.[^21][^22]

Introduction
Yoruba religion is an indigenous African tradition originating among the Yoruba people of West Africa, emphasizing a hierarchy of deities, ancestor veneration, and harmony with nature. It often blends with Christianity or Islam in syncretic forms.
View on God
The supreme creator is Olodumare (or Olorun), an omnipotent, transcendent being who delegates authority to lesser deities called orisha (e.g., 400+ spirits like Orunmila for wisdom, Oshun for fertility). God is not anthropomorphic but manifests through nature and orisha, who act as intermediaries. Polytheistic elements coexist with a monotheistic supreme entity.12
View on Afterlife
Death is not the end but a transformation. The soul (emi) continues, with ancestors influencing the living. Good lives lead to reincarnation or ancestral status; evil may result in unrest or punishment. Rituals ensure peaceful transition, with no strict heaven/hell but a spiritual realm where the dead interact with descendants.34
In greater detail, the Yoruba concept of the afterlife, known as Oku, views death as a transition to the spiritual realm called ara orun or Ikole Orun (Heaven). The soul, or emi, is the breath of life bestowed by Olodumare, and upon death, it separates from the body. Reincarnation, termed Atunwa, is a key belief, often occurring within the family lineage, as reflected in names like Babatunde ("father returns") or Yetunde ("mother returns"). This rebirth carries accumulated wisdom from previous lives, with one aspect of the soul (the Guardian Ori) returning to earth while another remains in the ancestral realm. Ancestors, or egun, reside in ara orun and continue to guide and protect the living, influencing daily affairs through blessings or interventions. Evil deeds may lead to spiritual unrest or denial of ancestral status, preventing reincarnation. Rituals, such as the Egungun masquerade festivals, honor ancestors and facilitate communication, involving costumes, dances, and offerings to maintain harmony between the living and the dead.567
View on Ethics
Ethics emphasize communal harmony, virtues like love, temperance, honesty, honor, and morality. Moral codes derive from orisha teachings and proverbs, promoting respect for elders, truthfulness, and balance (iwapele). Taboos (eewo) guide behavior, with divination (If√°) advising ethical paths.89
Demographics
Approximately 20-40 million adherents globally, primarily in Nigeria (Yorubaland, ~20 million Yoruba people), Benin, Togo, and diaspora communities in the Americas (e.g., Brazil, Cuba via syncretic forms like Santer√≠a/Candombl√©). Growth is stable but declining due to conversion to Christianity/Islam; ~10-15% of Yoruba practice purely traditional forms.1011
Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Yoruba religion has interacted extensively with Christianity, particularly through historical missionary influences in West Africa and syncretism in diaspora communities. In traditional Yoruba contexts, many adherents have converted to Christianity, leading to a decline in purely indigenous practices, though elements like orisha veneration often persist alongside Christian beliefs. Christianity is sometimes viewed as a complementary or alternative system, with some Yoruba interpreting biblical figures through indigenous lenses.
In diaspora forms, such as Santer√≠a (in Cuba and the Caribbean) and Candombl√© (in Brazil), Yoruba religion has blended with Roman Catholicism due to historical enslavement and forced conversions. This syncretism equates Christian saints and figures with orishas: for example, Jesus Christ may be associated with orishas like Obatala (a creator deity symbolizing purity and peace) or other benevolent spirits, while the Virgin Mary is often linked to Yemaya (goddess of the sea and motherhood). Saints like Saint James (Santiago) are syncretized with Shango (god of thunder and justice). These blended traditions allow practitioners to maintain Yoruba spiritual practices under the guise of Catholicism, viewing Jesus as a powerful spiritual entity or intermediary akin to an orisha, though not central to core Yoruba theology. Such syncretic views emphasize harmony between systems rather than conflict, with rituals incorporating Christian prayers alongside Yoruba offerings.12131415

I‚Äôll generate text files (in Markdown format, as previously established) for the religions listed, focusing on theological stances (God, afterlife, ethics) with historical details for Abrahamic religions and demographics for smaller/indigenous ones, as per your earlier guidance. Each file will include a section on the religion‚Äôs perspective on Jesus/Christianity, especially for Yoruba and other relevant groups, while maintaining neutrality. The files will use lowercase slugs from the YAML (where applicable) or derived from names (lowercase, hyphenated) for consistency. I‚Äôll cover the first batch of religions from your list, specifically the Indigenous & Folk (standalone ‚Äî no umbrella) category (~15 religions), to keep the response manageable and avoid content limits. Let me know which category to tackle next after this.
Each file will be:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion (e.g., shinto.md, yoruba.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Afterlife (expanded for detail), View on Ethics, Demographics (for indigenous), and Relation to Christianity/Jesus.
Sources: Neutral, academic (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database), cited as Markdown footnotes.
File naming: Lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., native-american-religions.md for Native American religions).
Due to the volume, I‚Äôll provide a few sample files below to confirm the format, then summarize the rest with a plan to generate them. If this works, I can proceed with the remaining categories (e.g., Ancient/Historical Survivals) in batches.shinto.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢yoruba.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢akan.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢Plan for Remaining Indigenous & Folk Religions
To avoid overwhelming this response, I‚Äôve provided three sample files (Shinto, Yoruba, Akan) from the Indigenous & Folk category. The remaining 12 religions in this category (Santer√≠a, Candombl√©, Umbanda, Vodou, Native American religions, Aboriginal Australian traditions, MƒÅori religion, Pacific Islander faiths, Dinka, Zulu, Maasai, San/Khoisan) will follow the same structure:
Introduction: Brief overview of origins and key features.
View on God: Theological stance (polytheistic, animistic, etc.).
View on Afterlife: Detailed beliefs, emphasizing spiritual realms, reincarnation, or ancestral roles.
View on Ethics: Moral codes and community values.
Demographics: Population estimates, geographic spread, and trends.
Relation to Christianity/Jesus: Syncretism or views on Jesus, especially for diaspora religions like Santer√≠a, Candombl√©, Umbanda, and Vodou, which have strong Christian influences.
Sources: Cited from neutral sources (Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR).
I can generate these 12 files in the next batch or proceed to another category (e.g., Ancient/Historical Survivals). Each file will be ~500-1,000 words, in Markdown, with slugs like santeria.md, haitian-vodou.md, etc.
Next Steps
Confirm format: Are the sample files (structure, length, tone) suitable? Any tweaks needed (e.g., more/less detail on Jesus, different sections)?
Choose next batch: Should I complete the remaining Indigenous & Folk religions (12 files), or move to another category like Ancient/Historical Survivals (Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, etc.)?
Volume control: I‚Äôll batch ~10-15 files per response to stay within limits. Want a specific number per batch?
Let me know your preferences, and I‚Äôll get the next set rolling!25 web pagesWriting is great & Good tone!!
Adding afterlife could come
After the Jesus section. I don‚Äôt mind say 1-2 less article outputs if it helped.
Let‚Äôs go top to bottom of our list. It probably doesn‚Äôt matter as long as we reach our 140.Thought for 55ssanteria.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢candomble.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢umbanda.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢haitian-vodou.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢native-american-religions.mdmarkdown‚Ä¢Plan for Remaining Religions in the List
I've generated 5 more files for the next religions in the Indigenous & Folk category (Santer√≠a to Native American religions). This completes part of the category, with 7 left (Aboriginal Australian, MƒÅori, Pacific Islander, Dinka, Zulu, Maasai, San/Khoisan).
To keep responses manageable and avoid limits, the next batch can cover those 7. After that, move to the Ancient / Historical Survivals category (Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, etc.).
Confirm: Does this reordered structure (Afterlife after Jesus section) work? Any tweaks to detail level or sources? Let me know which batch next!117 web pagesYes please2¬†/¬†2Great, I'm glad the reordered structure (with the Afterlife section following the Relation to Christianity and Jesus section) and the tone work for you! I'll proceed with generating Markdown files for the remaining 7 religions in the Indigenous & Folk (standalone ‚Äî no umbrella) category from your list: Aboriginal Australian traditions, MƒÅori religion, Pacific Islander faiths, Dinka religion, Zulu traditional belief, Maasai religion, and San/Khoisan traditions. Each file will follow the established format:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., aboriginal-dreamtime.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will complete the Indigenous & Folk category, bringing us to 12/15 from your list. To stay within response limits and keep things manageable, I'll provide all 7 files below. After this, we can move to the next category (e.g., Ancient / Historical Survivals) or another of your choice, aiming toward your goal of 140 articles. Let me know if you want adjustments or a specific next batch!
