text# Haitian Vodou
## Introduction
Haitian Vodou is a syncretic religion blending West African Vodun with Catholicism, developed during slavery. It involves lwa worship, rituals, and possession ceremonies.
## View on God
Haitian Vodou is monotheistic, worshiping Bondye as supreme, with lwa like Legba as intermediaries.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect and offerings. Taboos involve disrespecting lwa.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 2â€“5 million followers, primarily in Haiti and diaspora. Growth is steady.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is syncretized as a lwa. Christianity is integrated.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^15]
