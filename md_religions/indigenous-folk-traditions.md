# Indigenous & Folk Traditions

## Introduction
Indigenous & Folk Traditions encompass global indigenous religions, from African Yoruba to Pacific cargo cults, emphasizing local deities, ancestors, and nature. These faiths involve rituals, dances, and oral traditions to maintain spiritual and communal harmony. Despite colonial suppression, they persist through revival, often blending with Christianity or Islam, shaping cultural identities worldwide from Australia to the Americas.

## View on God
These traditions vary, often polytheistic or monotheistic, venerating creator gods, spirits, or ancestors. Divinity is immanent in nature and community.

## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect for ancestors, nature, and rituals. Taboos involve disrupting sacred spaces or traditions.

## Demographics
Approximately 400–500 million followers globally, across Africa, the Americas, and Pacific regions. Growth is tied to cultural revival and syncretism.[^16]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a spirit, prophet, or deity (e.g., in Vodou). Christianity is widely integrated, complementing indigenous practices in many communities.

## View on Afterlife
The afterlife typically involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals like funerals ensure the soul’s harmony with spirits or nature.
