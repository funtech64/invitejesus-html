# Americas (Traditional & Syncretic)

## Introduction
Americas Traditional & Syncretic religions encompass indigenous and blended faiths across the Americas, from Navajo spirituality to Afro-Caribbean Vodou. Rooted in pre-Columbian traditions, they emphasize nature, ancestors, and spirits, with syncretic forms like Santería blending African and Catholic elements. Rituals include dances, offerings, and healing ceremonies, persisting despite colonial suppression, often alongside Christianity, in communities from North America to Brazil.

## View on God
These religions vary, often polytheistic or monotheistic, venerating creator gods (e.g., Great Spirit) or spirits like *lwa*. Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.

## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and harmony. Moral codes include respect for nature, ancestors, and rituals. Taboos involve disrupting spiritual balance or sacred sites.

## Demographics
Approximately 10–20 million followers, primarily in the US, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Growth is tied to Indigenous and diaspora revival.[^6]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is frequently syncretized as a spirit or deity (e.g., in Vodou). Christianity is deeply integrated, with saints and rituals blending into traditional practices.

## View on Afterlife
The afterlife typically involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals like funerals ensure the soul’s harmony with spirits or nature.
