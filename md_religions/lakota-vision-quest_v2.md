text# Lakota Vision Quest
## Introduction
The Lakota Vision Quest is a traditional rite of the Lakota people in the US Great Plains, involving fasting and prayer for spiritual visions and guidance.
## View on God
The Vision Quest is monotheistic, worshipping Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit) as the supreme creator, with spirits providing visions.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on personal sacrifice and community. Moral codes include respect, prayer, and humility. Taboos involve avoiding spiritual quests.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000 participants, primarily in South Dakota and Montana. Growth is tied to Lakota population.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes seen as a spirit or healer. Christianity is integrated in some quests.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves a spiritual realm with ancestors. No heaven or hell; the Vision Quest strengthens the soul for eternal harmony.[^15]
