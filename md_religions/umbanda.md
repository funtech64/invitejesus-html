text# Umbanda
## Introduction
Umbanda is a syncretic religion founded in Brazil in the early 20th century, blending African (Yoruba, Bantu), Catholic, and Spiritist elements. It emphasizes spirit mediumship, healing, and rituals to connect with spirits.
## View on God
Umbanda is monotheistic with polytheistic elements, worshiping Olorun (Zambi) as the supreme creator. Orixás and spirits (e.g., caboclos, pretos velhos) act as intermediaries, often syncretized with Catholic saints.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on charity, spiritual growth, and community harmony. Moral codes emphasize healing, respect for spirits, and ethical mediumship. Taboos include misusing spiritual powers or harming others.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
Approximately 400,000–1 million adherents, primarily in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo), with small communities in the US and Europe. Growth is modest, competing with evangelical Christianity.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Umbanda integrates Catholicism, viewing Jesus as a divine figure or high spirit, often equated with Oxalá. Practitioners attend Catholic services, blending Christian prayers with spirit worship. Jesus is respected but not central.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife combines Spiritist and African beliefs, with souls reincarnating or joining spirits in a spiritual realm. No eternal heaven/hell; rituals like mediumship and offerings ensure spiritual progress and ancestral harmony.[^39][^40]
