## Introduction
The Dinka religion, practiced by the Dinka people of South Sudan, is a traditional faith centered on Nhialic (supreme creator) and ancestral spirits.
## View on God
Dinka religion is monotheistic, worshiping Nhialic as the supreme creator, with spirits and ancestors as intermediaries.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and harmony. Moral codes include respect, offerings, and unity. Taboos involve disrespecting spirits.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 4â€“5 million followers, primarily in South Sudan. Growth is tied to Dinka population.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a spirit or prophet. Christianity is widely integrated.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms. No heaven/hell; rituals ensure spiritual continuity.[^5]
