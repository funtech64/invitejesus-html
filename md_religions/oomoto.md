text# Oomoto
## Introduction
Oomoto, founded in 1892 by Deguchi Nao in Japan, is a new religious movement blending Shinto and spiritualism, emphasizing world peace and divine inspiration.
## View on God
Oomoto is monotheistic, worshiping a universal God (Ushitora no Konjin) who inspires humanity. Kami (spirits) are secondary manifestations.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony and spiritual purity. Moral codes include compassion, peace, and ritual observance. Taboos involve conflict and impurity.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000–200,000 followers, primarily in Japan, with small global communities. Growth is limited by its niche appeal.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine, respected alongside other prophets. Christianity is a parallel path within Oomoto’s universalism.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals like chanting prepare the soul for divine harmony.[^5]
