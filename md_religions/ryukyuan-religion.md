text# Ryukyuan Religion
## Introduction
Ryukyuan religion is the indigenous spirituality of the Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa, Japan), blending Shinto, animism, and ancestor worship. It emphasizes rituals led by priestesses (noro) to honor kami and ancestors, maintaining cultural identity.
## View on God
Ryukyuan religion is polytheistic and animistic, with kami (spirits) inhabiting nature, ancestors, and sacred sites. No supreme God dominates; key figures include Amamikyu (creator goddess). The cosmos is filled with spiritual forces guiding human life.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature and ancestors. Moral codes emphasize respect, purity, and community cohesion, with taboos against polluting sacred sites. Rituals like utaki worship reinforce ethical living.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 adherents in Okinawa, Japan, often alongside Shinto or Buddhism. Declining due to modernization and Christian influence (~10% of Okinawans practice purely traditional beliefs).[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Christianity spread through 19th-century missions, but Ryukyuan religion remains distinct. Jesus is not central, though some view him as a foreign kami or teacher. Syncretism is rare, with traditionalists prioritizing local spirits.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves souls joining ancestors in a spiritual realm, often tied to sacred sites like utaki. No heaven/hell; spirits may reincarnate or guide the living. Rituals ensure peaceful transitions and ancestral connection.[^49][^50]
