text# Wicca
## Introduction
Wicca is a modern pagan religion, developed in the mid-20th century by Gerald Gardner in England. It emphasizes nature worship, magic, and a balance of feminine and masculine divine energies, often practiced in covens or solitarily.
## View on God
Wicca is polytheistic and duotheistic, centering on the Goddess (often lunar, associated with nature) and the Horned God (solar, linked to fertility). Practitioners may also honor pantheons from various cultures (e.g., Celtic, Norse). The divine is immanent in nature, with no single supreme deity.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics follow the Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will," emphasizing personal freedom balanced with non-harm. Moral codes promote respect for nature, community, and magical responsibility. The Threefold Law suggests actions return threefold, encouraging ethical magic.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 1–2 million adherents globally, primarily in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Growth is steady due to its appeal in New Age and feminist circles, though numbers are hard to verify due to solitary practice.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Wicca emerged in a Christian-dominated West but rejects Christian theology, viewing it as patriarchal. Jesus is typically seen as a historical or mythical figure, not divine, with some Wiccans respecting his teachings on compassion but prioritizing pagan deities. No significant syncretism exists.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
Wicca’s afterlife beliefs vary, often involving reincarnation or a spiritual realm like the Summerland, a place of rest and reflection between lives. No universal heaven/hell; the soul cycles through lives based on karma or learning, with rituals like Samhain honoring the dead and facilitating spiritual transitions.[^9][^10]
