text# Deism
## Introduction
Deism is an 18th-century philosophical movement, prominent during the Enlightenment, emphasizing a rational belief in a non-interventionist creator God. It rejects revealed religion and supernatural doctrines.
## View on God
Deism is monotheistic, believing in a single, rational creator God who designed the universe but does not intervene. God is impersonal, known through reason and nature, not revelation.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on reason and natural morality, emphasizing virtue, justice, and compassion. Moral codes reject divine commandments, focusing on human welfare. Taboos include superstition and fanaticism.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 10–50 million people globally align with deist principles, primarily in the US, Europe, and Latin America, often within secular or philosophical circles. Numbers are hard to verify due to its non-organized nature.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Deism rejects Christian theology, viewing Jesus as a historical moral teacher, not divine. Deists respect Jesus’ ethics (e.g., Golden Rule) but deny his divinity and miracles, seeing Christianity as a revealed religion.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
Deism’s afterlife views vary; many deny an afterlife, focusing on earthly life. Some believe in a rational afterlife where the soul persists in a natural state, without heaven/hell. No rituals address the afterlife, with emphasis on reason.[^49][^50]
