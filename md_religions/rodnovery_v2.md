text# Rodnovery
## Introduction
Rodnovery, revived in the 20th century in Eastern Europe, is a neo-pagan religion based on Slavic mythology, emphasizing nature and ancestral worship.
## View on God
Rodnovery is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Perun and Mokosh. Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and harmony. Moral codes include respect, ritual, and environmentalism. Taboos involve dishonor and harm.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. Growth is modest.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is often rejected due to historical Slavic-Christian conflicts.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes Iriy (paradise) or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals honor ancestors.[^15]
