text# Samaritanism
## Introduction
Samaritanism is an ancient Abrahamic religion practiced by Samaritans in Israel and the West Bank, dating to the 8th century BCE. It is based on the Samaritan Pentateuch and emphasizes the covenant at Mount Gerizim.
## View on God
Samaritanism is monotheistic, worshiping YHWH as the one true God, transcendent and personal. No Trinity or intermediaries; God is central, revealed through the Torah.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are rooted in the Samaritan Pentateuch, emphasizing obedience to God’s commandments, purity, and community. Moral codes include Sabbath observance and charity. Taboos include idolatry and impurity.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 800–1,000 adherents, primarily in Israel (Mount Gerizim) and the West Bank. Growth is minimal due to a small, closed community.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Samaritanism predates Christianity and rejects Jesus as a prophet or Messiah, viewing him as a false figure. Christianity is seen as a divergent religion, with historical tensions due to Samaritan-Jewish conflicts.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves resurrection and judgment, with the righteous entering paradise (Garden of Eden) and the wicked facing punishment. Rituals like Passover sacrifices prepare the soul for divine judgment.[^29][^30]
