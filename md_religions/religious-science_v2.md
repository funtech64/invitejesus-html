text# Religious Science
## Introduction
Religious Science, founded in 1927 by Ernest Holmes in the US, is a New Thought movement emphasizing spiritual mind treatment and positive thinking.
## View on God
Religious Science is pantheistic, viewing God as universal spirit or mind. Divinity is immanent in all.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on positive thinking and harmony. Moral codes include affirmation, love, and compassion. Taboos involve negativity.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“20,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is modest.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual exemplar, not divine. Christianity is reinterpreted metaphysically.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual continuity or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; treatment prepares the soul.[^20]
