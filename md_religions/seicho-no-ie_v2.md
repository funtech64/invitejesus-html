## Introduction
Navajo religion is the traditional spiritual tradition of the Navajo people in the US Southwest, emphasizing harmony (hózhó) and spiritual beings like Changing Woman.
## View on God
Navajo religion is polytheistic, venerating Holy People like Changing Woman and First Man. Divinity is immanent in nature and cosmology.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on hózhó (balance and beauty). Moral codes include respect for nature, family, and rituals like the Blessingway ceremony. Taboos involve disrupting harmony or sacred sites.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 300,000 adherents, primarily in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Growth is tied to Navajo population, with some blending with Christianity.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is sometimes viewed as a healer or syncretized with Navajo spirits. Many Navajos practice Christianity alongside traditional beliefs.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves the soul returning to the underworld or joining ancestors, with reincarnation possible in some beliefs. No heaven or hell; ceremonies like the Sing ensure the soul's peaceful transition and maintain hózhó.[^5]
