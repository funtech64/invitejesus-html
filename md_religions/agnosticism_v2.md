text# Agnosticism
## Introduction
Agnosticism, coined by Thomas Huxley in the 19th century, is a worldview withholding judgment on the existence of gods due to insufficient evidence.
## View on God
Agnosticism neither affirms nor denies gods, emphasizing uncertainty and skepticism.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on reason and empathy. Moral codes include inquiry and tolerance. Taboos involve dogmatism.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 600â€“800 million adherents, primarily in Europe and North America. Growth is steady.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, with divinity uncertain. Christianity is respected but questioned.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife is uncertain; no definitive stance. Focus is on earthly life.[^10]
