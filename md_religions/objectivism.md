text# Objectivism
## Introduction
Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by Ayn Rand in the 20th century, emphasizing reason, individualism, and laissez-faire capitalism. While not a religion, it functions as a worldview for some, with ethical and metaphysical implications.
## View on God
Objectivism is atheistic, rejecting any form of God or supernatural existence. Reality is objective, governed by natural laws, with reason as the sole means of understanding.[^61][^62]
## View on Ethics
Ethics are based on rational self-interest, with individual happiness as the moral purpose. Moral codes promote productivity, honesty, and personal achievement, with taboos against altruism (in the sacrificial sense) and irrationality.[^63][^64]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–50,000 people globally identify with Objectivism, primarily in the US, with smaller communities in Europe and Canada. Growth is limited due to its niche philosophical appeal.[^65][^66]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Objectivism rejects Christianity as irrational and altruistic. Jesus is seen as a historical figure promoting self-sacrifice, contrary to Objectivist ethics. No engagement with Christian theology exists.[^67][^68]
## View on Afterlife
Objectivism denies an afterlife, asserting that consciousness ends at death. No heaven, hell, or reincarnation; the focus is on achieving values in this life. No rituals address the afterlife, with emphasis on rational living.[^69][^70]

Progress and Plan
Completed: 88/140 articles (12 Indigenous & Folk + 6 Ancient / Historical Survivals + 4 Indian Subcontinent Minorities + 7 East Asian New Religions + 4 African Independent Movements + 8 Pagan & Revivalist Movements + 2 Syncretic & Ayahuasca + 6 Esoteric & Occult + 14 New Religious Movements + 12 Umbrella-Claimant Cults + 6 Major Religions + 7 Secular & Philosophical Movements). This completes the Secular & Philosophical Movements category.
Next Category: I recommend moving to Indigenous American Religions (6 religions: Navajo, Lakota, Cherokee, Mapuche, Andean, Native American Church) for the next batch, continuing top-to-bottom. Alternatively, we can start a new category (e.g., Pacific & Oceanic Religions) or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections).
Batch Size: This batch had 7 files, fitting within response limits. I can continue with ~5-7 files per batch or adjust as needed.
Format Check: The structure (Introduction, God, Ethics, Demographics, Christianity/Jesus, Afterlife) and tone remain consistent. Any tweaks needed (e.g., more detail on any section, source adjustments)?
Sources: Using Britannica, Pew, World Religion Database, JSTOR, and Wikipedia (where reliable). Any sources to add or avoid?
Let me know your preferred next batch (e.g., Indigenous American Religions) or any adjustments, and I’ll generate the next set of files!They’re great pls continueThanks for the love on these files! I'll dive into the Indigenous American Religions category, covering 6 religions: Navajo, Lakota, Cherokee, Mapuche, Andean, and Native American Church. Each file will follow the established Markdown structure:
Format: Markdown (.md), one file per religion, using lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., navajo.md).
Content: Sections for Introduction, View on God, View on Ethics, Demographics, Relation to Christianity and Jesus, and View on Afterlife (expanded for detail).
Sources: Neutral, academic sources (e.g., Britannica, Pew Research, World Religion Database, JSTOR), cited as Markdown footnotes.
Focus: Theological stances on God, ethics, afterlife, plus demographics and perspectives on Jesus/Christianity, maintaining neutrality.
This batch will bring us to 94/140 articles toward your goal. After this, I suggest moving to Pacific & Oceanic Religions (5 religions: Hawaiian, Māori, Aboriginal Dreamtime, John Frum, Polynesian traditions) for the next batch, or you can pick another category or revisit earlier ones for deeper detail (e.g., expanding afterlife sections). Let me know your preference or any tweaks!
