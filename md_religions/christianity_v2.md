## Introduction
Christianity, the world’s largest religion, originated in the 1st century CE in Judea, centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Rooted in Jewish traditions, it spread across the Roman Empire, evolving into diverse denominations like Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. Christians worship in churches, using rituals like the Eucharist and baptism to express faith. The religion has shaped Western civilization, influencing art, law, and ethics, while spreading globally through missions. Despite schisms, it remains unified by core beliefs in Jesus as Savior.
## History
Christianity began with Jesus’ ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection, as recorded in the New Testament. Early followers faced Roman persecution until Emperor Constantine’s Edict of Milan (313 CE) legalized it. The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) defined key doctrines. The Great Schism (1054) split East (Orthodox) and West (Catholic), while the Reformation (16th century) birthed Protestantism. Today, Christianity spans diverse cultures, from African Pentecostalism to Latin American Catholicism.
## View on God
Christianity is monotheistic, worshiping one God in the Trinity: Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit. Jesus is divine, the incarnate Son, central to salvation.
## View on Ethics
Ethics stem from Jesus’ teachings, like the Sermon on the Mount. Moral codes emphasize love, charity, forgiveness, and humility. Taboos include idolatry, murder, and adultery. Denominations vary, with Catholics stressing tradition and Protestants scripture.
## Practices
Key practices include prayer, worship (Sunday Mass or services), sacraments (baptism, Eucharist), and fasting (e.g., Lent). Evangelism and charity are central, with missions spreading the faith globally.
## Key Texts
The Bible, comprising the Old Testament (Jewish scriptures) and New Testament (Gospels, Epistles), is the primary text. Creeds like the Nicene Creed summarize beliefs.
## Demographics
Approximately 2.4 billion followers (31% of the world), primarily in Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Growth is strong in Africa and Asia, with decline in Europe.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is the divine Son of God, the Savior who died for humanity’s sins and rose again. Christianity is self-referential, with Jesus as its core.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves heaven for the saved and hell for the damned, with some denominations (e.g., Catholics) including purgatory. Salvation comes through faith, works, or both, depending on the tradition.
