## Introduction
The Satanic Temple, founded in 2013 in the US, is a new religious movement promoting atheistic Satanism as a symbol of rebellion, focusing on social justice and separation of church and state.
## View on God
The Satanic Temple is atheistic, rejecting gods. Satan is a metaphor for defiance and reason.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on justice and empathy. Moral codes include compassion, science, and rights. Taboos involve oppression and dogma.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is steady due to activism.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is critiqued for dogma.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
No afterlife exists; death is final. No heaven/hell; focus on earthly justice.[^25]
