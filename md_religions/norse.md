## Introduction
Norse religion, practiced by Germanic and Scandinavian peoples from circa 500–1000 CE, is a polytheistic tradition centered on gods like Odin and Thor, preserved in texts like the *Eddas*. It emphasizes heroism, fate, and nature.
## View on God
Norse religion is polytheistic, with gods like Odin (wisdom), Thor (thunder), and Freyja (fertility) governing cosmic and human affairs. No single supreme deity; gods are anthropomorphic, with spirits (landvættir) in nature.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on honor, courage, and loyalty to kin and gods. Moral codes emphasize bravery, hospitality, and ritual offerings. Taboos include cowardice, oath-breaking, and disrespecting sacred sites.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
No widespread adherents today; extinct by the 12th century CE. Historically practiced by millions in Scandinavia and Germanic regions. Modern Ásatrú revivals number ~20,000–50,000 globally (US, Iceland, Europe).[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Norse religion was replaced by Christianity in the Middle Ages. Jesus had no role in Norse theology, but Christian missionaries equated him with Baldr (a slain god). Modern Ásatrú practitioners often reject Christianity, though some blend Jesus as a cultural figure.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife varied: warriors joined Odin in Valhalla or Freyja in Fólkvangr for feasting; others went to Hel, a neutral underworld. No eternal hell; rituals like ship burials ensured honor in death.[^9][^10]
