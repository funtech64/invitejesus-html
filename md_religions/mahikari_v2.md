text# Mahikari
## Introduction
Mahikari, founded in 1959 by Yoshikazu Okada in Japan, is a new religious movement emphasizing divine light healing (Mahikari) and spiritual purification.
## View on God
Mahikari is monotheistic, worshiping Su-God as the supreme creator. Divine light channels spiritual energy.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and harmony. Moral codes include gratitude, service, and light-giving. Taboos involve negativity.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000â€“1 million followers, primarily in Japan and Brazil. Growth is modest.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; light rituals prepare the soul.[^10]
