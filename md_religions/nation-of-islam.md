text# Nation of Islam
## Introduction
The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a religious and political movement founded in 1930 by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad in the United States, later led by Elijah Muhammad. It blends Islamic and Black nationalist elements, emphasizing African-American empowerment.
## View on God
The NOI is monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the supreme creator, distinct from mainstream Islam’s theology. Wallace Fard Muhammad is considered a divine figure or Messiah, with Elijah Muhammad as his prophet. God is seen as a Black deity, tied to African identity.[^1][^2]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on Black pride, self-reliance, and discipline. Moral codes include strict dress codes, dietary laws (e.g., avoiding pork), and community unity. Taboos include assimilation into "white" culture, immorality, and disloyalty to the NOI.[^3][^4]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000–100,000 adherents, primarily in the US (Chicago, Detroit). Growth is modest, limited by its specific racial focus and competition with mainstream Islam.[^5][^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The NOI rejects mainstream Christianity as a tool of oppression, viewing it as the "white man’s religion." Jesus is seen as a prophet, not divine, with NOI teachings emphasizing Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad over Christian figures. Some Christian elements are reinterpreted through a Black nationalist lens.[^7][^8]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife aligns with a modified Islamic eschatology, with the righteous entering a paradise tied to Black liberation, often seen as a restored African homeland. The wicked face judgment or spiritual exclusion. No eternal hell is emphasized; NOI rituals focus on earthly empowerment for divine destiny, with practices like prayer and fasting preparing believers.[^9][^10]
