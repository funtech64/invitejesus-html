text# Universal Medicine
## Introduction
Universal Medicine, founded in 1999 by Serge Benhayon in Australia, is a spiritual movement blending esotericism and healing, emphasizing the "Livingness" philosophy.
## View on God
Universal Medicine is monistic, viewing God as a universal energy within all beings. No personal deity is central.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on self-love and energetic integrity. Moral codes include healthy living, meditation, and compassion. Taboos involve negativity and harm.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 followers, primarily in Australia and the UK. Growth is limited by controversy.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary to Universal Medicine’s teachings.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul for divine harmony.[^5]
