text# Heathenry (Ásatrú)
## Introduction
Heathenry, or Ásatrú, is a modern revival of Norse paganism, emerging in the 20th century in Iceland and spreading globally. It honors Norse gods and emphasizes community, honor, and connection to ancestral traditions.
## View on God
Heathenry is polytheistic, worshiping Norse gods like Odin, Thor, and Freyja, alongside land spirits (wights). No supreme deity dominates; the gods are powerful but not omnipotent, embodying natural and human forces.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on honor, courage, and community loyalty. Moral codes include the Nine Noble Virtues (e.g., courage, truth, hospitality), with rituals like blót (offerings) reinforcing values. Taboos include dishonor and neglecting ancestors.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 adherents, primarily in Iceland, Scandinavia, the US, and Germany. Growth is steady due to interest in Norse heritage.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Heathenry rejects Christianity, which historically suppressed Norse paganism. Jesus is seen as a foreign figure, irrelevant to Norse cosmology, though some Heathens respect his ethical teachings. No significant syncretism exists.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes realms like Valhalla (for warriors), Hel (a neutral underworld), or reincarnation within family lines. No universal heaven/hell; souls join ancestors or cycle based on deeds, with rituals like funerals ensuring spiritual continuity.[^29][^30]
