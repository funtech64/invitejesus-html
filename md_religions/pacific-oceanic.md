# Pacific & Oceanic

## Introduction
Pacific & Oceanic religions encompass indigenous faiths of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Australia, including Hawaiian, Māori, and Aboriginal Dreamtime traditions. These emphasize gods, ancestors, and land connections, with rituals like hula or *corroborees* maintaining spiritual balance. Cargo cults like John Frum emerged post-colonization, blending indigenous and Western elements. Revival efforts preserve these faiths, often with Christian syncretism, across Pacific islands.

## View on God
These religions are polytheistic, venerating gods like Tangaloa (Polynesia) or the Rainbow Serpent (Australia). Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.

## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and guardianship (*kaitiakitanga*). Moral codes include respect for land, rituals, and elders. Taboos involve violating sacred spaces or ancestors.

## Demographics
Approximately 2–5 million followers, primarily in Polynesia, Melanesia, and Australia. Growth is tied to Indigenous revival.[^11]

## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a spirit or god (e.g., in Māori religion). Christianity, introduced by missionaries, is widely integrated, complementing traditional practices.

## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms (e.g., *Hawaiki*) or reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals ensure the soul’s harmony with ancestors or nature.
