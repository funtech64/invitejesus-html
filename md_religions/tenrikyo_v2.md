text# Tenrikyo
## Introduction
Tenrikyo is a Japanese religion founded in 1838 by Nakayama Miki, emphasizing joy and divine providence. Based on the *Ofudesaki*, it blends Shinto and Buddhist elements.
## View on God
Tenrikyo is monotheistic, worshiping Tenri-O-no-Mikoto, the God of divine reason, who created humans for joy. No lesser deities are central.[^1]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on a joyous life through sincerity and gratitude. Moral codes include mutual help and ritual purity. Taboos include selfishness and harming others.[^2]
## Demographics
Approximately 1â€“2 million adherents, primarily in Japan, with communities in the US and Brazil. Growth is modest.[^3]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Tenrikyo views Jesus as a moral teacher, not divine, with minimal Christian engagement. Its cosmology is distinct.[^4]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or a spiritual realm of joy. No heaven/hell; rituals like the Kagura service prepare the soul.[^5]
