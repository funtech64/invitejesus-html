text# Chishti
## Introduction
The Chishti Order, founded in the 10th century by Abu Ishaq Shami in Afghanistan, is a Sufi order emphasizing love, tolerance, and music within Sunni Islam.
## View on God
Chishti is monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the sole God. Love-based mysticism connects to divinity.[^11]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and humility. Moral codes include dhikr, charity, and music. Taboos involve pride and intolerance.[^12]
## Demographics
Approximately 5â€“15 million followers, primarily in South Asia. Growth is steady within Islam.[^13]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a prophet, not divine, per Islamic belief. Christianity is respected as a monotheistic faith.[^14]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic beliefs: paradise or hell. Sufi music and dhikr prepare the soul.[^15]
