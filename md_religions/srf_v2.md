text# Self-Realization Fellowship
## Introduction
Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF), founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda in the US, is a spiritual movement teaching Kriya Yoga for self-realization.
## View on God
SRF is monistic, viewing God as universal consciousness. Divinity is within all.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual purity. Moral codes include yoga, nonviolence, and truth. Taboos involve egoism.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 followers, primarily in the US and India. Growth is modest.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual master, not uniquely divine. Christianity is respected.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until moksha. No heaven/hell; yoga prepares the soul.[^25]
