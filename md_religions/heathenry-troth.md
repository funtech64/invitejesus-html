text# Heathenry (The Troth)
## Introduction
Heathenry (The Troth), founded in 1987 in the US, is a neo-pagan group reviving Norse spirituality, emphasizing inclusivity and scholarship.
## View on God
The Troth is polytheistic, worshiping Norse gods like Odin and Freyja. Divinity is immanent in nature and ancestors.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and honor. Moral codes include hospitality, truth, and ritual. Taboos involve harm and exclusion.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 followers, primarily in the US and Europe. Growth is limited by its scholarly focus.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a historical figure, not divine. Christianity is distanced due to historical tensions with paganism.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife includes Hel, Valhalla, or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals honor ancestors for continuity.[^10]
