text# Qadiriyya
## Introduction
The Qadiriyya Order, founded in the 12th century by Abdul Qadir Gilani in Iraq, is a Sufi order emphasizing devotion and spiritual connection within Sunni Islam.
## View on God
Qadiriyya is monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the sole God. Mystical practices deepen divine connection.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and submission. Moral codes include dhikr, charity, and humility. Taboos involve arrogance and immorality.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 5â€“10 million followers, primarily in South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Growth is steady.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a prophet, not divine, per Islamic belief. Christianity is respected as a monotheistic faith.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Islamic beliefs: paradise or hell based on deeds. Sufi practices prepare the soul.[^10]
