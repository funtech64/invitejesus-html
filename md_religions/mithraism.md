text# Mithraism
## Introduction
Mithraism was a mystery religion practiced in the Roman Empire from the 1st to 4th centuries CE, centered on the god Mithras, derived from Persian traditions. It emphasized initiation and cosmic salvation, popular among soldiers.
## View on God
Mithraism was monotheistic or henotheistic, worshiping Mithras as a solar deity and mediator of cosmic order, often linked to Sol Invictus. Other gods (e.g., Ahura Mazda) were secondary in Roman practice.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on loyalty, courage, and ritual purity, tied to Mithraic initiations. Moral codes emphasized brotherhood and discipline, with taboos against impurity or disloyalty to Mithras.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 5th century CE. Historically practiced by thousands in the Roman Empire, especially among military and elites. Modern revivals are negligible.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Mithraism coexisted with early Christianity, sharing motifs like salvation and divine birth. Jesus had no role in Mithraism, but parallels (e.g., Mithras’ birth, communal meals) influenced Christian iconography.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved the soul’s ascent through celestial spheres to a divine realm, guided by Mithras. No clear heaven/hell; initiatory rituals prepared the soul for cosmic salvation.[^29][^30]
