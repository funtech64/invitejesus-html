text# Children of God (Family International)
## Introduction
The Children of God, later called the Family International, is a new religious movement founded in 1968 by David Berg in the United States. Rooted in Christianity, it emphasizes communal living, evangelism, and controversial practices like "flirty fishing."
## View on God
The Children of God is monotheistic, worshiping the Christian God as the supreme creator. Jesus is central, with Berg seen as a prophet. God is personal, guiding followers through revelations and communal life.[^41][^42]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love, sharing, and spreading God’s word. Moral codes emphasize communalism, sexual openness (historically controversial), and devotion. Taboos include rejecting Berg’s teachings or mainstream societal norms.[^43][^44]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000–10,000 adherents, primarily in the US, Europe, and Latin America. Declining since the 1990s due to controversies and leadership changes.[^45][^46]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
The movement is explicitly Christian, viewing Jesus as the Son of God and savior. Berg’s teachings reinterpret Christianity with apocalyptic and communal emphases, using the Bible as a primary text. Jesus is central to salvation and daily life.[^47][^48]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife follows Christian eschatology, with the righteous entering heaven, a paradise with God, and the wicked facing hell or judgment. Berg’s prophecies emphasize an imminent apocalypse, with rituals like prayer preparing believers for heaven.[^49][^50]
