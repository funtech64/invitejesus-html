text# Toltec
## Introduction
Toltec religion, practiced in Mesoamerica (circa 900â€“1168 CE), was a polytheistic tradition influencing Aztec culture. Centered on deities and cosmic balance, it is known from archaeological and textual evidence.
## View on God
Toltec religion was polytheistic, with deities like Quetzalcoatl (feathered serpent) and Tezcatlipoca (creator/trickster). No single supreme deity; gods governed natural and human affairs.[^31][^32]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on divine service and cosmic order. Moral codes likely emphasized loyalty, sacrifice, and community, inferred from Aztec parallels. Taboos included neglecting rituals or disrespecting gods.[^33][^34]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 12th century CE. Historically practiced by thousands in central Mexico. Modern revivals are minimal.[^35][^36]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Toltec religion predates Christianity, with no direct contact. Post-conquest, some Mesoamerican descendants equated Jesus with Quetzalcoatl. Toltec theology had no role for Jesus.[^37][^38]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife likely involved a spiritual realm where souls joined deities or ancestors, similar to Aztec beliefs. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like offerings ensured divine favor.[^39][^40]
