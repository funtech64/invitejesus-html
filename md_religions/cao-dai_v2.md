text# Cao Dai
## Introduction
Cao Dai is a Vietnamese syncretic religion founded in 1926 by Ngô Văn Chiêu, blending Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Christianity. It emphasizes unity and divine revelation.
## View on God
Cao Dai is monotheistic, worshiping Cao Đài (Supreme God), a cosmic deity revealed through spiritism. Lesser spirits guide humanity.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on compassion, justice, and spiritual growth. Moral codes include vegetarianism and prayer. Taboos include violence and dishonesty.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 4–6 million adherents, primarily in Vietnam, with diaspora in the US and Australia. Growth is stable.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Cao Dai incorporates Jesus as a divine messenger alongside Buddha. Christianity is respected but secondary to Cao Dai’s syncretic theology.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation until achieving unity with Cao Đài. No heaven/hell; rituals like séances prepare the soul.[^10]
