text# Divine Science
## Introduction
Divine Science, founded in the 1880s by Malinda Cramer in the US, is a New Thought movement emphasizing divine presence and mental healing.
## View on God
Divine Science is pantheistic, viewing God as omnipresent spirit. Divinity is within all beings.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and harmony. Moral codes include prayer, compassion, and positive thinking. Taboos involve fear.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 5,000â€“10,000 followers, primarily in the US. Growth is limited.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but reinterpreted.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual evolution. No heaven/hell; prayer prepares the soul.[^25]
