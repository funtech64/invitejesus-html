text# Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery)
## Introduction
Slavic Native Faith, or Rodnovery, is a modern revival of pre-Christian Slavic paganism, emerging in the 20th century in Eastern Europe. It honors Slavic gods and emphasizes ancestral traditions and nature worship.
## View on God
Rodnovery is polytheistic, worshiping gods like Perun (thunder), Veles (underworld), and Mokosh (earth). Some are monistic, seeing Rod (the cosmic principle) as a unifying force. The divine is immanent in nature.[^51][^52]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on honor, community, and harmony with nature. Moral codes include respect for ancestors, truth, and hospitality, with rituals like offerings reinforcing values. Taboos include disrespecting sacred sites.[^53][^54]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“50,000 adherents, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. Growth is modest, driven by nationalist and cultural revival movements.[^55][^56]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Rodnovery rejects Christianity, which displaced Slavic paganism. Jesus is seen as a foreign figure, with no role in Rodnovery. Some respect his ethics but prioritize Slavic gods and traditions.[^57][^58]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves realms like Nav (underworld) or Iriy (paradise), with souls joining ancestors or reincarnating. No heaven/hell; rituals like Dziady honor the dead and ensure spiritual harmony.[^59][^60]
