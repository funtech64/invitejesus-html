text# Rajneesh / Osho
## Introduction
The Rajneesh movement, founded by Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh) in the 1960s in India, emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and spiritual freedom, blending Eastern and Western traditions.
## View on God
The movement is non-theistic, viewing God as consciousness or existence, not a personal deity. The focus is on inner divinity.[^16]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on awareness and freedom. Moral codes include meditation, love, and non-judgment. Taboos involve repression and dogmatism.[^17]
## Demographics
Approximately 20,000–50,000 adherents, primarily in India, the US, and Europe. Growth is limited by controversies.[^18]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a mystic or enlightened teacher, not divine. Christianity is respected but seen as rigid compared to Osho’s teachings.[^19]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation or merging with universal consciousness. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^20]
