text# God Light Association (GLA)
## Introduction
God Light Association (GLA), founded in 1969 by Shinji Takahashi in Japan, is a new religious movement blending Buddhism and New Age ideas, emphasizing divine light.
## View on God
GLA is monotheistic, worshiping a universal God of light. Takahashi is a spiritual guide.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on love and growth. Moral codes include compassion and meditation. Taboos involve negativity.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000â€“50,000 followers, primarily in Japan. Growth is limited.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^25]
