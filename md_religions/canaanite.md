text# Canaanite
## Introduction
Canaanite religion, practiced in the ancient Levant (circa 2000–300 BCE), was a polytheistic tradition of the Canaanite peoples, influencing Israelite religion. It centered on deities tied to nature and society, preserved in texts like the Baal Cycle.
## View on God
Canaanite religion was polytheistic, with gods like El (creator), Baal (storm), and Asherah (fertility). No single supreme God; deities were interconnected, ruling over natural and human domains.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics revolved around divine favor through rituals and moral conduct. Moral codes emphasized loyalty, fertility, and justice, with offerings to appease gods. Taboos included blasphemy and neglecting sacred duties.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
No living adherents today; extinct by the 1st century BCE. Historically practiced by millions in the Levant (modern Lebanon, Israel). Some neo-pagan revivals exist but are minimal.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Canaanite religion influenced early Israelite monotheism, shaping the Hebrew Bible. Jesus had no role in Canaanite theology, but Christian concepts like divine kingship and angels reflect Canaanite influences.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife was a shadowy underworld (Mot’s realm), where souls existed as shades with little distinction between the righteous and wicked. No heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured the dead’s rest, with some elite souls serving gods.[^19][^20]
