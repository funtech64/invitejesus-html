## Introduction
The Community of Christ, founded in 1860 as a reorganized branch of Mormonism by Joseph Smith III, is a Christian denomination emphasizing peace, community, and scripture. Evolving from early LDS teachings, it rejects polygamy and focuses on inclusive worship, social justice, and global mission. Members gather in congregations for sacraments like baptism and the Lordâ€™s Supper, using the Book of Mormon alongside the Bible. Headquartered in Missouri, it balances restorationist roots with modern Christian values, appealing to those seeking a progressive Mormon identity.
## View on God
The Community is monotheistic, worshiping one God in Trinity. Jesus is divine, the Son of God.
## View on Ethics

## Demographics
Approximately 250,000 followers, primarily in the US and globally. Growth is modest due to progressive shifts.[^21]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is central as Savior. The Community aligns with mainstream Christianity while retaining unique scriptures.
## View on Afterlife
