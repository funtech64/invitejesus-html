## Introduction
Baltic religion, practiced by Baltic peoples (e.g., Lithuanians, Latvians) from circa 1000 BCE–1400 CE, was a polytheistic tradition centered on deities like Perkūnas and Žemyna. It emphasizes nature and is preserved in folklore.
## View on God
Baltic religion was polytheistic and animistic, with gods like Perkūnas (thunder), Žemyna (earth), and Dievas (sky). No single supreme deity; spirits inhabited nature and ancestors.[^21][^22]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focused on harmony with nature and community. Moral codes emphasized respect for deities, family, and ritual observance. Taboos included polluting sacred sites or disrespecting ancestors.[^23][^24]
## Demographics
No widespread adherents today; extinct by the 15th century CE. Historically practiced by thousands in Lithuania and Latvia. Modern Romuva revivals number ~5,000–10,000 globally.[^25][^26]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Baltic religion was replaced by Christianity in the Middle Ages. Jesus had no role in Baltic theology, but Christian missionaries adapted local festivals and equated Jesus with Dievas in some communities.[^27][^28]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involved a spiritual realm (Dausos) where souls joined ancestors or gods, often tied to nature. No clear heaven/hell; rituals like burials ensured peaceful transitions.[^29][^30]
