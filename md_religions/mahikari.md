text# Mahikari
## Introduction
Mahikari, founded in 1959 by Yoshikazu Okada in Japan, is a spiritual movement emphasizing divine light (Mahikari) for healing and purification, rooted in Shinto.
## View on God
Mahikari is monotheistic, worshiping Su-God, the supreme creator. Divine light channels spiritual energy for humanity’s salvation.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on purity and healing. Moral codes include gratitude, service, and light-giving rituals. Taboos involve negativity and impurity.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 500,000–1 million followers, primarily in Japan and Brazil. Growth is modest due to its esoteric focus.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a spiritual figure, not divine, respected as a healer. Christianity is a parallel path, secondary to Mahikari’s teachings.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual realms or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; light-giving rituals prepare the soul for divine unity.[^10]
