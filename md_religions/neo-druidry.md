text# Neo-Druidry
## Introduction
Neo-Druidry is a modern pagan revival of ancient Celtic spiritual practices, emerging in the 18th century and formalized in the 20th century. It emphasizes nature reverence, ritual, and connection to Celtic heritage, practiced by groups like OBOD and ADF.
## View on God
Neo-Druidry is polytheistic and animistic, honoring Celtic deities (e.g., Cernunnos, Brigid) and spirits of nature. Some practitioners are monistic, seeing a universal spirit in all things. The divine is immanent, with no single supreme deity.[^11][^12]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on harmony with nature, community, and personal growth. Moral codes emphasize respect for the earth, truth, and creativity, with rituals like the Eight Festivals (e.g., Samhain) reinforcing ethical living. No strict taboos, but environmental harm is frowned upon.[^13][^14]
## Demographics
Approximately 50,000â€“100,000 adherents, primarily in the UK, US, and Ireland. Growth is modest, driven by interest in Celtic spirituality and environmentalism.[^15][^16]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Neo-Druidry often rejects Christian theology due to its historical suppression of paganism. Jesus is viewed as a moral teacher or mythic figure by some, but not divine. Some Druids incorporate Christian elements (e.g., in Christian Druidry), but most prioritize Celtic traditions.[^17][^18]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife varies, often involving reincarnation or a spiritual realm like the Otherworld, a Celtic-inspired place of peace and wisdom. No heaven/hell; souls cycle through lives or join ancestors, with rituals like funerals aiding transitions and honoring the dead.[^19][^20]
