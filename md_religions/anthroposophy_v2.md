text# Anthroposophy
## Introduction
Anthroposophy, founded in 1913 by Rudolf Steiner in Europe, is a spiritual philosophy emphasizing human spiritual development and cosmic wisdom, rooted in Theosophy.
## View on God
Anthroposophy is pantheistic, viewing divinity as a cosmic spirit pervading all existence. Christ is a central spiritual figure, not a personal God.[^6]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on spiritual freedom and moral intuition. Moral codes include compassion, creativity, and self-development. Taboos involve materialism and dogmatism.[^7]
## Demographics
Approximately 10,000–20,000 adherents, primarily in Europe (Germany, Switzerland) and the US. Growth is modest, tied to Waldorf schools.[^8]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Anthroposophy views Jesus as the Christ, a cosmic being embodying divine love, distinct from traditional Christianity’s theology.[^9]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves reincarnation and spiritual planes, with souls evolving toward divine wisdom. No heaven/hell; meditation prepares the soul.[^10]
