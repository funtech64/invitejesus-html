text# Islam
## Introduction
Islam, the second-largest religion, originated in 7th-century Arabia with the Prophet Muhammad’s revelations, recorded in the Quran. Centered on submission to Allah, it spread rapidly across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, forming Sunni and Shia branches. Muslims worship in mosques, following the Five Pillars (faith, prayer, charity, fasting, pilgrimage). Islam has shaped art, law, and science, with a global presence influencing cultures from Indonesia to Morocco.
## History
Muhammad’s revelations began in 610 CE in Mecca. After persecution, he migrated to Medina (622 CE), establishing a community. Islam unified Arabia by his death (632 CE). The Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates expanded it, followed by the Abbasid Golden Age. The Sunni-Shia split emerged over leadership succession. Today, Islam spans diverse nations, with revival movements like Salafism.
## View on God
Islam is monotheistic, worshiping Allah as the sole, transcendent creator. No Trinity or intermediaries; Allah is unique.
## View on Ethics
Ethics derive from the Quran and Hadith, emphasizing justice, charity, and submission. Moral codes include honesty, modesty, and community welfare. Taboos involve idolatry, pork, and alcohol.
## Practices
The Five Pillars guide practice: Shahada (faith declaration), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting in Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage). Sufi mysticism adds spiritual practices like *dhikr*.
## Key Texts
The Quran is the divine word of Allah. Hadith (Muhammad’s sayings) and *Sharia* (Islamic law) guide daily life.
## Demographics
Approximately 1.9 billion followers (25%), primarily in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Growth is rapid in Africa and Asia.[^6]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a revered prophet, not divine, born of the Virgin Mary. Islam respects Christianity as a monotheistic faith but rejects the Trinity.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves paradise (Jannah) for the righteous and hell (Jahannam) for the wicked, judged on deeds. Rituals prepare the soul.
