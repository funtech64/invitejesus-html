text# Church of Perfect Liberty
## Introduction
The Church of Perfect Liberty, founded in 1924 by Tokumitsu Kanada in Japan, is a new religious movement emphasizing self-expression and a joyous life through divine principles.
## View on God
The Church is monotheistic, worshiping a universal God of life. Divine principles guide followers.[^21]
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on joy and creativity. Moral codes include gratitude and self-expression. Taboos involve negativity.[^22]
## Demographics
Approximately 100,000â€“200,000 followers, primarily in Japan and Brazil. Growth is modest.[^23]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is a moral figure, not divine. Christianity is respected but secondary.[^24]
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves spiritual harmony or reincarnation. No heaven/hell; rituals prepare the soul.[^25]
