# Africa (Traditional Religions)
## Introduction
African Traditional Religions encompass diverse indigenous faiths across sub-Saharan Africa, rooted in oral traditions and centered on ancestors, spirits, and harmony with nature. Practiced by ethnic groups like the Yoruba and Akan, they involve rituals, divination, and festivals to honor deities and ancestors. Despite colonial suppression, these religions persist in rural and urban communities, often blending with Christianity or Islam, shaping cultural practices like music and dance across the continent.
## View on God
African Traditional Religions vary, often monotheistic or polytheistic, worshiping a supreme creator (e.g., Nyame among the Akan) alongside lesser spirits and ancestors. Divinity is immanent in nature and community.
## View on Ethics
Ethics focus on community and balance. Moral codes include respect for elders, reciprocity, and ritual observance. Taboos involve disrespecting ancestors or sacred sites, believed to disrupt harmony.
## Demographics
Approximately 100–200 million followers, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Benin). Growth is tied to cultural revival, with syncretism common.[^1]
## Relation to Christianity and Jesus
Jesus is often syncretized as a spirit or prophet, especially in syncretic churches. Christianity is widely integrated, with traditional rituals complementing Christian practices in many communities.
## View on Afterlife
The afterlife involves ancestral realms or reincarnation. No heaven or hell; rituals like funerals ensure the soul’s connection to ancestors and spiritual harmony.
