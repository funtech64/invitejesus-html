    <h1>Argument 2: Proof of Miracles</h1>
    <h2>Argument 2: A Rational Case for Prophecy and the Person of Jesus</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>I. Premise: Can a Divine Claim Be Tested Without Assuming One?</h3>
      <p>Let’s begin with a simple question:
      Is it possible to evaluate a claim of divine origin using objective methods—without first accepting religious assumptions?</p>
      <p>You don’t need to believe the Bible is divinely inspired to consider this question. Instead, we ask:
      What if we treat biblical texts like any other historical document and test them on their own terms?</p>
      <p>Here’s the proposed test:
      If a text repeatedly and accurately describes future events—beyond the scope of human foresight—should it not deserve our attention, regardless of origin?</p>
      <p>We'll focus on a specific case:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One passage: Daniel 11</li>
        <li>One method: Probability theory</li>
        <li>One claim: Jesus of Nazareth as the fulfillment of prophecy</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>II. Daniel 11: A Case Study in Predictive Specificity</h3>
      <p>Daniel 11 is a section of Hebrew Scripture that lays out over 100 political and military events spanning roughly 365 years (from ~530 BC to 165 BC).</p>
      <p>These predictions align remarkably with documented history—from the Persian Empire through the rise of Greece and the Seleucid-Ptolemaic conflicts.</p>
      <p>There are only two logical possibilities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It was written before the events occurred (genuine prophecy)</li>
        <li>It was written after the events (as historical fiction presented as prophecy)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Even critical scholars agree on two points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The historical alignment is unusually precise and sustained.</li>
        <li>If composed after the events, it is an unparalleled literary achievement in predictive detail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, fragments of Daniel have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which date to a period before some of these events occurred—complicating the late-authorship theory.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: Daniel 11 serves as a uniquely detailed test case. If true predictive prophecy is possible, it would likely resemble this.</p>

      <h3>III. Quantifying the Improbable: Probability Theory Meets Prophecy</h3>
      <p>Dr. Peter Stoner, a mathematician, applied the laws of probability to biblical prophecy to determine whether fulfilled predictions could be attributed to chance.</p>
      <p>Let’s assume—conservatively—that there was a 1 in 5 chance of predicting each event in Daniel 11 correctly (which is generous, given the geopolitical complexity involved). For 100 accurate predictions, that results in:</p>
      <p>(1/5)<sup>100</sup> = 1 in 7.9 × 10<sup>69</sup></p>
      <p>Under stricter assumptions (1 in 10 per event), the result becomes even more implausible:</p>
      <p>(1/10)<sup>100</sup> = 1 in 10<sup>100</sup></p>
      <p>These odds approach the level of statistical impossibility. The probability of such a sustained, correct sequence occurring by random chance is so low it demands an alternative explanation.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: Either Daniel 11 is a mathematically implausible coincidence, or it reflects a source of knowledge not constrained by time.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>IV. Messianic Prophecy and the Case for Jesus</h3>
      <p>Turning to the New Testament, we find the claim that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled dozens of ancient prophecies, some written centuries apart.</p>
      <p>Dr. Stoner again applied probability to this question. For just eight specific Messianic prophecies (e.g., born in Bethlehem, betrayed for 30 silver coins), he calculated:</p>
      <p>1 in 10<sup>17</sup> (1 followed by 17 zeros)</p>
      <p>For 48 Messianic prophecies:
      1 in 10<sup>157</sup></p>
      <p>These predictions were made by different authors over centuries, yet converge on a single figure in history. The probability of this being accidental becomes mathematically negligible.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: If Daniel 11 sets the precedent that prophecy can be real, then the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy in Jesus invites serious, reasoned investigation.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>V. An Analogy of Scale: Voyager 1 and the Impossibility of Chance</h3>
      <p>To grasp the improbability visually, consider the analogy from Stoner's original work:</p>
      <p>Imagine covering the entire state of Texas two feet deep in silver dollars. One of them is marked. Then blindfold a person, let them wander anywhere they wish, and pick a single coin. The chance they select the marked one is roughly 1 in 10<sup>17</sup>—the same probability of Jesus fulfilling just eight prophecies by chance.</p>
      <p>Stretching that analogy even further:
      If you placed 10<sup>17</sup> coins edge-to-edge, the chain would stretch 2.37 trillion miles—more than 150 times the current distance of Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object in space.</p>
      <p>This isn’t just a metaphor—it illustrates the astronomical improbability of coincidence.</p>

      <h3>VI. Final Thought: What Do These Numbers Actually Tell Us?</h3>
      <p>You’re not being asked to start with belief.</p>
      <p>Instead, you're invited to examine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daniel 11 as a historically grounded case study in predictive writing</li>
        <li>Probability theory as an impartial tool for analysis</li>
        <li>Messianic prophecy as a convergence of independent data points</li>
        <li>The scale of improbability, which transcends anecdote and enters statistical law</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of this leads to a reasonable, measured question:</p>
      <p>What kind of document makes these claims—and who could be behind them?</p>
      <p>This isn’t about blind faith. It’s about being intellectually honest in the face of unlikely precision. And that is where the deeper conversation about Jesus Christ begins.</p>
